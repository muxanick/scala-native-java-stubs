/** Abstract class representing a collection of Permission objects.
 * 
 *  With a PermissionCollection, you can:
 *  
 *   add a permission to the collection using the add method.
 *   check to see if a particular permission is implied in the
 *       collection, using the implies method.
 *   enumerate all the permissions, using the elements method.
 *  
 * 
 *  When it is desirable to group together a number of Permission objects
 *  of the same type, the newPermissionCollection method on that
 *  particular type of Permission object should first be called. The default
 *  behavior (from the Permission class) is to simply return null.
 *  Subclasses of class Permission override the method if they need to store
 *  their permissions in a particular PermissionCollection object in order
 *  to provide the correct semantics when the
 *  PermissionCollection.implies method is called.
 *  If a non-null value is returned, that PermissionCollection must be used.
 *  If null is returned, then the caller of newPermissionCollection
 *  is free to store permissions of the
 *  given type in any PermissionCollection they choose
 *  (one that uses a Hashtable, one that uses a Vector, etc).
 * 
 *  The PermissionCollection returned by the
 *  Permission.newPermissionCollection
 *  method is a homogeneous collection, which stores only Permission objects
 *  for a given Permission type.  A PermissionCollection may also be
 *  heterogeneous.  For example, Permissions is a PermissionCollection
 *  subclass that represents a collection of PermissionCollections.
 *  That is, its members are each a homogeneous PermissionCollection.
 *  For example, a Permissions object might have a FilePermissionCollection
 *  for all the FilePermission objects, a SocketPermissionCollection for all the
 *  SocketPermission objects, and so on. Its add method adds a
 *  permission to the appropriate collection.
 * 
 *  Whenever a permission is added to a heterogeneous PermissionCollection
 *  such as Permissions, and the PermissionCollection doesn't yet contain a
 *  PermissionCollection of the specified permission's type, the
 *  PermissionCollection should call
 *  the newPermissionCollection method on the permission's class
 *  to see if it requires a special PermissionCollection. If
 *  newPermissionCollection
 *  returns null, the PermissionCollection
 *  is free to store the permission in any type of PermissionCollection it
 *  desires (one using a Hashtable, one using a Vector, etc.). For example,
 *  the Permissions object uses a default PermissionCollection implementation
 *  that stores the permission objects in a Hashtable.
 * 
 *   Subclass implementations of PermissionCollection should assume
 *  that they may be called simultaneously from multiple threads,
 *  and therefore should be synchronized properly.  Furthermore,
 *  Enumerations returned via the elements method are
 *  not fail-fast.  Modifications to a collection should not be
 *  performed while enumerating over that collection.
