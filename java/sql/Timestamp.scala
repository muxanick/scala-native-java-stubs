/** A thin wrapper around java.util.Date that allows
 *  the JDBC API to identify this as an SQL TIMESTAMP value.
 *  It adds the ability
 *  to hold the SQL TIMESTAMP fractional seconds value, by allowing
 *  the specification of fractional seconds to a precision of nanoseconds.
 *  A Timestamp also provides formatting and
 *  parsing operations to support the JDBC escape syntax for timestamp values.
 * 
 *  The precision of a Timestamp object is calculated to be either:
 *  
 *  19 , which is the number of characters in yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
 *    20 + s , which is the number
 *  of characters in the yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.[fff...] and s represents  the scale of the given Timestamp,
 *  its fractional seconds precision.
 * 
 * 
 *  Note: This type is a composite of a java.util.Date and a
 *  separate nanoseconds value. Only integral seconds are stored in the
 *  java.util.Date component. The fractional seconds - the nanos - are
 *  separate.  The Timestamp.equals(Object) method never returns
 *  true when passed an object
 *  that isn't an instance of java.sql.Timestamp,
 *  because the nanos component of a date is unknown.
 *  As a result, the Timestamp.equals(Object)
 *  method is not symmetric with respect to the
 *  java.util.Date.equals(Object)
 *  method.  Also, the hashCode method uses the underlying
 *  java.util.Date
 *  implementation and therefore does not include nanos in its computation.
 *  
 *  Due to the differences between the Timestamp class
 *  and the java.util.Date
 *  class mentioned above, it is recommended that code not view
 *  Timestamp values generically as an instance of
 *  java.util.Date.  The
 *  inheritance relationship between Timestamp
 *  and java.util.Date really
 *  denotes implementation inheritance, and not type inheritance.
