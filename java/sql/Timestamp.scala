// A thin wrapper around java.util.Date that allows
// the JDBC API to identify this as an SQL TIMESTAMP value.
// It adds the ability
// to hold the SQL TIMESTAMP fractional seconds value, by allowing
// the specification of fractional seconds to a precision of nanoseconds.
// A Timestamp also provides formatting and
// parsing operations to support the JDBC escape syntax for timestamp values.
//
// The precision of a Timestamp object is calculated to be either:
// 
// 19 , which is the number of characters in yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
//   20 + s , which is the number
// of characters in the yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.[fff...] and s represents  the scale of the given Timestamp,
// its fractional seconds precision.
//
//
// Note: This type is a composite of a java.util.Date and a
// separate nanoseconds value. Only integral seconds are stored in the
// java.util.Date component. The fractional seconds - the nanos - are
// separate.  The Timestamp.equals(Object) method never returns
// true when passed an object
// that isn't an instance of java.sql.Timestamp,
// because the nanos component of a date is unknown.
// As a result, the Timestamp.equals(Object)
// method is not symmetric with respect to the
// java.util.Date.equals(Object)
// method.  Also, the hashCode method uses the underlying
// java.util.Date
// implementation and therefore does not include nanos in its computation.
// 
// Due to the differences between the Timestamp class
// and the java.util.Date
// class mentioned above, it is recommended that code not view
// Timestamp values generically as an instance of
// java.util.Date.  The
// inheritance relationship between Timestamp
// and java.util.Date really
// denotes implementation inheritance, and not type inheritance.
