// The mapping in the Javaâ„¢ programming language
// for the SQL CLOB type.
// An SQL CLOB is a built-in type
// that stores a Character Large Object as a column value in a row of
// a database table.
// By default drivers implement a Clob object using an SQL
// locator(CLOB), which means that a Clob object
// contains a logical pointer to the SQL CLOB data rather than
// the data itself. A Clob object is valid for the duration
// of the transaction in which it was created.
// The Clob interface provides methods for getting the
// length of an SQL CLOB (Character Large Object) value,
// for materializing a CLOB value on the client, and for
// searching for a substring or CLOB object within a
// CLOB value.
// Methods in the interfaces ResultSet,
// CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement, such as
// getClob and setClob allow a programmer to
// access an SQL CLOB value.  In addition, this interface
// has methods for updating a CLOB value.
// 
// All methods on the Clob interface must be fully implemented if the
// JDBC driver supports the data type.
