/** The mapping in the Javaâ„¢ programming language
 *  for the SQL CLOB type.
 *  An SQL CLOB is a built-in type
 *  that stores a Character Large Object as a column value in a row of
 *  a database table.
 *  By default drivers implement a Clob object using an SQL
 *  locator(CLOB), which means that a Clob object
 *  contains a logical pointer to the SQL CLOB data rather than
 *  the data itself. A Clob object is valid for the duration
 *  of the transaction in which it was created.
 *  The Clob interface provides methods for getting the
 *  length of an SQL CLOB (Character Large Object) value,
 *  for materializing a CLOB value on the client, and for
 *  searching for a substring or CLOB object within a
 *  CLOB value.
 *  Methods in the interfaces ResultSet,
 *  CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement, such as
 *  getClob and setClob allow a programmer to
 *  access an SQL CLOB value.  In addition, this interface
 *  has methods for updating a CLOB value.
 *  
 *  All methods on the Clob interface must be fully implemented if the
 *  JDBC driver supports the data type.
