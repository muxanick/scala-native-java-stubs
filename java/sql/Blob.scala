import java.io.{InputStream, OutputStream}

// The representation (mapping) in
// the Javaâ„¢ programming
// language of an SQL
// BLOB value.  An SQL BLOB is a built-in type
// that stores a Binary Large Object as a column value in a row of
// a database table. By default drivers implement Blob using
// an SQL locator(BLOB), which means that a
// Blob object contains a logical pointer to the
// SQL BLOB data rather than the data itself.
// A Blob object is valid for the duration of the
// transaction in which is was created.
//
// Methods in the interfaces ResultSet,
// CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement, such as
// getBlob and setBlob allow a programmer to
// access an SQL BLOB value.
// The Blob interface provides methods for getting the
// length of an SQL BLOB (Binary Large Object) value,
// for materializing a BLOB value on the client, and for
// determining the position of a pattern of bytes within a
// BLOB value. In addition, this interface has methods for updating
// a BLOB value.
// 
// All methods on the Blob interface must be fully implemented if the
// JDBC driver supports the data type.
