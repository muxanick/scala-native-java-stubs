/** The representation (mapping) in
 *  the Javaâ„¢ programming
 *  language of an SQL
 *  BLOB value.  An SQL BLOB is a built-in type
 *  that stores a Binary Large Object as a column value in a row of
 *  a database table. By default drivers implement Blob using
 *  an SQL locator(BLOB), which means that a
 *  Blob object contains a logical pointer to the
 *  SQL BLOB data rather than the data itself.
 *  A Blob object is valid for the duration of the
 *  transaction in which is was created.
 * 
 *  Methods in the interfaces ResultSet,
 *  CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement, such as
 *  getBlob and setBlob allow a programmer to
 *  access an SQL BLOB value.
 *  The Blob interface provides methods for getting the
 *  length of an SQL BLOB (Binary Large Object) value,
 *  for materializing a BLOB value on the client, and for
 *  determining the position of a pattern of bytes within a
 *  BLOB value. In addition, this interface has methods for updating
 *  a BLOB value.
 *  
 *  All methods on the Blob interface must be fully implemented if the
 *  JDBC driver supports the data type.
