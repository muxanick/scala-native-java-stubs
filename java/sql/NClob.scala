/** The mapping in the Javaâ„¢ programming language
 *  for the SQL NCLOB type.
 *  An SQL NCLOB is a built-in type
 *  that stores a Character Large Object using the National Character Set
 *   as a column value in a row of  a database table.
 *  The NClob interface extends the Clob interface
 *  which provides provides methods for getting the
 *  length of an SQL NCLOB value,
 *  for materializing a NCLOB value on the client, and for
 *  searching for a substring or NCLOB object within a
 *  NCLOB value. A NClob object, just like a Clob object, is valid for the duration
 *  of the transaction in which it was created.
 *  Methods in the interfaces ResultSet,
 *  CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement, such as
 *  getNClob and setNClob allow a programmer to
 *  access an SQL NCLOB value.  In addition, this interface
 *  has methods for updating a NCLOB value.
 *  
 *  All methods on the NClob interface must be fully implemented if the
 *  JDBC driver supports the data type.
