/** Represents implementations of URLConnection caches. An instance of
 *  such a class can be registered with the system by doing
 *  ResponseCache.setDefault(ResponseCache), and the system will call
 *  this object in order to:
 * 
 *     store resource data which has been retrieved from an
 *             external source into the cache
 *          try to fetch a requested resource that may have been
 *             stored in the cache
 *     
 * 
 *  The ResponseCache implementation decides which resources
 *  should be cached, and for how long they should be cached. If a
 *  request resource cannot be retrieved from the cache, then the
 *  protocol handlers will fetch the resource from its original
 *  location.
 * 
 *  The settings for URLConnection#useCaches controls whether the
 *  protocol is allowed to use a cached response.
 * 
 *  For more information on HTTP caching, see RFCÂ 2616: Hypertext
 *  Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
