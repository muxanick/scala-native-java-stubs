/** This class is for various network permissions.
 *  A NetPermission contains a name (also referred to as a "target name") but
 *  no actions list; you either have the named permission
 *  or you don't.
 *  
 *  The target name is the name of the network permission (see below). The naming
 *  convention follows the  hierarchical property naming convention.
 *  Also, an asterisk
 *  may appear at the end of the name, following a ".", or by itself, to
 *  signify a wildcard match. For example: "foo.*" and "*" signify a wildcard
 *  match, while "*foo" and "a*b" do not.
 *  
 *  The following table lists all the possible NetPermission target names,
 *  and for each provides a description of what the permission allows
 *  and a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission.
 * 
 *  
 *  
 *  Permission Target Name
 *  What the Permission Allows
 *  Risks of Allowing this Permission
 *  
 *  
 *    allowHttpTrace
 *    The ability to use the HTTP TRACE method in HttpURLConnection.
 *    Malicious code using HTTP TRACE could get access to security sensitive
 *    information in the HTTP headers (such as cookies) that it might not
 *    otherwise have access to.
 *    
 * 
 *  
 *    getCookieHandler
 *    The ability to get the cookie handler that processes highly
 *    security sensitive cookie information for an Http session.
 *    Malicious code can get a cookie handler to obtain access to
 *    highly security sensitive cookie information. Some web servers
 *    use cookies to save user private information such as access
 *    control information, or to track user browsing habit.
 *    
 * 
 *  
 *   getNetworkInformation
 *   The ability to retrieve all information about local network interfaces.
 *   Malicious code can read information about network hardware such as
 *   MAC addresses, which could be used to construct local IPv6 addresses.
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *    getProxySelector
 *    The ability to get the proxy selector used to make decisions
 *    on which proxies to use when making network connections.
 *    Malicious code can get a ProxySelector to discover proxy
 *    hosts and ports on internal networks, which could then become
 *    targets for attack.
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *    getResponseCache
 *    The ability to get the response cache that provides
 *    access to a local response cache.
 *    Malicious code getting access to the local response cache
 *    could access security sensitive information.
 *    
 * 
 *  
 *    requestPasswordAuthentication
 *    The ability
 *  to ask the authenticator registered with the system for
 *  a password
 *    Malicious code may steal this password.
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *    setCookieHandler
 *    The ability to set the cookie handler that processes highly
 *    security sensitive cookie information for an Http session.
 *    Malicious code can set a cookie handler to obtain access to
 *    highly security sensitive cookie information. Some web servers
 *    use cookies to save user private information such as access
 *    control information, or to track user browsing habit.
 *    
 * 
 *  
 *    setDefaultAuthenticator
 *    The ability to set the
 *  way authentication information is retrieved when
 *  a proxy or HTTP server asks for authentication
 *    Malicious
 *  code can set an authenticator that monitors and steals user
 *  authentication input as it retrieves the input from the user.
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *    setProxySelector
 *    The ability to set the proxy selector used to make decisions
 *    on which proxies to use when making network connections.
 *    Malicious code can set a ProxySelector that directs network
 *    traffic to an arbitrary network host.
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *    setResponseCache
 *    The ability to set the response cache that provides access to
 *    a local response cache.
 *    Malicious code getting access to the local response cache
 *    could access security sensitive information, or create false
 *    entries in the response cache.
 *    
 * 
 *  
 *    specifyStreamHandler
 *    The ability
 *  to specify a stream handler when constructing a URL
 *    Malicious code may create a URL with resources that it would
 * normally not have access to (like file:/foo/fum/), specifying a
 * stream handler that gets the actual bytes from someplace it does
 * have access to. Thus it might be able to trick the system into
 * creating a ProtectionDomain/CodeSource for a class even though
 * that class really didn't come from that location.
 *
