/** Instances of the class Class represent classes and
 *  interfaces in a running Java application.  An enum is a kind of
 *  class and an annotation is a kind of interface.  Every array also
 *  belongs to a class that is reflected as a Class object
 *  that is shared by all arrays with the same element type and number
 *  of dimensions.  The primitive Java types (boolean,
 *  byte, char, short,
 *  int, long, float, and
 *  double), and the keyword void are also
 *  represented as Class objects.
 * 
 *   Class has no public constructor. Instead Class
 *  objects are constructed automatically by the Java Virtual Machine as classes
 *  are loaded and by calls to the defineClass method in the class
 *  loader.
 * 
 *   The following example uses a Class object to print the
 *  class name of an object:
 * 
 *  
 *      void printClassName(Object obj) {
 *          System.out.println("The class of " + obj +
 *                             " is " + obj.getClass().getName());
 *      }
 *  
 * 
 *   It is also possible to get the Class object for a named
 *  type (or for void) using a class literal.  See Section 15.8.2 of
 *  The Javaâ„¢ Language Specification.
 *  For example:
 * 
 *  
 *      System.out.println("The name of class Foo is: "+Foo.class.getName());
 *
