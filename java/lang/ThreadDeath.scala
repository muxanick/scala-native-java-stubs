/** An instance of ThreadDeath is thrown in the victim thread
 *  when the (deprecated) Thread.stop() method is invoked.
 * 
 *  An application should catch instances of this class only if it
 *  must clean up after being terminated asynchronously.  If
 *  ThreadDeath is caught by a method, it is important that it
 *  be rethrown so that the thread actually dies.
 * 
 *  The top-level error
 *  handler does not print out a message if ThreadDeath is
 *  never caught.
 * 
 *  The class ThreadDeath is specifically a subclass of
 *  Error rather than Exception, even though it is a
 *  "normal occurrence", because many applications catch all
 *  occurrences of Exception and then discard the exception.
