/** A method handle is a typed, directly executable reference to an underlying method,
 *  constructor, field, or similar low-level operation, with optional
 *  transformations of arguments or return values.
 *  These transformations are quite general, and include such patterns as
 *  conversion,
 *  insertion,
 *  deletion,
 *  and substitution.
 * 
 *  Method handle contents
 *  Method handles are dynamically and strongly typed according to their parameter and return types.
 *  They are not distinguished by the name or the defining class of their underlying methods.
 *  A method handle must be invoked using a symbolic type descriptor which matches
 *  the method handle's own type descriptor.
 *  
 *  Every method handle reports its type descriptor via the type accessor.
 *  This type descriptor is a MethodType object,
 *  whose structure is a series of classes, one of which is
 *  the return type of the method (or void.class if none).
 *  
 *  A method handle's type controls the types of invocations it accepts,
 *  and the kinds of transformations that apply to it.
 *  
 *  A method handle contains a pair of special invoker methods
 *  called invokeExact and invoke.
 *  Both invoker methods provide direct access to the method handle's
 *  underlying method, constructor, field, or other operation,
 *  as modified by transformations of arguments and return values.
 *  Both invokers accept calls which exactly match the method handle's own type.
 *  The plain, inexact invoker also accepts a range of other call types.
 *  
 *  Method handles are immutable and have no visible state.
 *  Of course, they can be bound to underlying methods or data which exhibit state.
 *  With respect to the Java Memory Model, any method handle will behave
 *  as if all of its (internal) fields are final variables.  This means that any method
 *  handle made visible to the application will always be fully formed.
 *  This is true even if the method handle is published through a shared
 *  variable in a data race.
 *  
 *  Method handles cannot be subclassed by the user.
 *  Implementations may (or may not) create internal subclasses of MethodHandle
 *  which may be visible via the Object.getClass
 *  operation.  The programmer should not draw conclusions about a method handle
 *  from its specific class, as the method handle class hierarchy (if any)
 *  may change from time to time or across implementations from different vendors.
 * 
 *  Method handle compilation
 *  A Java method call expression naming invokeExact or invoke
 *  can invoke a method handle from Java source code.
 *  From the viewpoint of source code, these methods can take any arguments
 *  and their result can be cast to any return type.
 *  Formally this is accomplished by giving the invoker methods
 *  Object return types and variable arity Object arguments,
 *  but they have an additional quality called signature polymorphism
 *  which connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.
 *  
 *  As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to invokeExact
 *  and invoke compile to an invokevirtual instruction.
 *  More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
 *  and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
 *  Instead, it must push them on the stack according to their own unconverted types.
 *  The method handle object itself is pushed on the stack before the arguments.
 *  The compiler then calls the method handle with a symbolic type descriptor which
 *  describes the argument and return types.
 *  
 *  To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
 *  the return type.  This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
 *  if there is one, or else Object if the invocation is an expression
 *  or else void if the invocation is a statement.
 *  The cast may be to a primitive type (but not void).
 *  
 *  As a corner case, an uncasted null argument is given
 *  a symbolic type descriptor of java.lang.Void.
 *  The ambiguity with the type Void is harmless, since there are no references of type
 *  Void except the null reference.
 * 
 *  Method handle invocation
 *  The first time a invokevirtual instruction is executed
 *  it is linked, by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
 *  and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
 *  This is true of calls to invokeExact and invoke.
 *  In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
 *  correct syntax and names it contains are resolved.
 *  Thus, an invokevirtual instruction which invokes
 *  a method handle will always link, as long
 *  as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
 *  and the types exist.
 *  
 *  When the invokevirtual is executed after linking,
 *  the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
 *  to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
 *  If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
 *  caller is invoking is not present on the individual
 *  method handle being invoked.
 *  
 *  In the case of invokeExact, the type descriptor of the invocation
 *  (after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
 *  of the receiving method handle.
 *  In the case of plain, inexact invoke, the resolved type descriptor
 *  must be a valid argument to the receiver's asType method.
 *  Thus, plain invoke is more permissive than invokeExact.
 *  
 *  After type matching, a call to invokeExact directly
 *  and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
 *  (or other behavior, as the case may be).
 *  
 *  A call to plain invoke works the same as a call to
 *  invokeExact, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
 *  exactly matches the method handle's own type.
 *  If there is a type mismatch, invoke attempts
 *  to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
 *  as if by a call to asType,
 *  to obtain an exactly invokable method handle M2.
 *  This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
 *  between caller and callee.
 *  
 *  (Note: The adjusted method handle M2 is not directly observable,
 *  and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)
 * 
 *  Invocation checking
 *  In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
 *  But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a WrongMethodTypeException,
 *  either directly (in the case of invokeExact) or indirectly as if
 *  by a failed call to asType (in the case of invoke).
 *  
 *  Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
 *  in a statically typed program can show up as
 *  a dynamic WrongMethodTypeException
 *  in a program which uses method handles.
 *  
 *  Because method types contain "live" Class objects,
 *  method type matching takes into account both types names and class loaders.
 *  Thus, even if a method handle M is created in one
 *  class loader L1 and used in another L2,
 *  method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
 *  descriptor, as resolved in L2,
 *  is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
 *  as resolved in L1.
 *  The resolution in L1 happens when M is created
 *  and its type is assigned, while the resolution in L2 happens
 *  when the invokevirtual instruction is linked.
 *  
 *  Apart from the checking of type descriptors,
 *  a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
 *  If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
 *  that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
 *  in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.
 *  
 *  Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
 *  a reflective method is invoked,
 *  method handle access checking is performed
 *  when the method handle is created.
 *  In the case of ldc (see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
 *  the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.
 *  
 *  Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
 *  should generally be kept secret.
 *  They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
 *  the untrusted code would be harmless.
 * 
 *  Method handle creation
 *  Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
 *  any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
 *  This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called
 *  MethodHandles.Lookup
 *  For example, a static method handle can be obtained
 *  from Lookup.findStatic.
 *  There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
 *  such as Lookup.unreflect.
 *  
 *  Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
 *  fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
 *  in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by ldc bytecodes.
 *  A new type of constant pool entry, CONSTANT_MethodHandle,
 *  refers directly to an associated CONSTANT_Methodref,
 *  CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref, or CONSTANT_Fieldref
 *  constant pool entry.
 *  (For full details on method handle constants,
 *  see sections 4.4.8 and 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)
 *  
 *  Method handles produced by lookups or constant loads from methods or
 *  constructors with the variable arity modifier bit (0x0080)
 *  have a corresponding variable arity, as if they were defined with
 *  the help of asVarargsCollector.
 *  
 *  A method reference may refer either to a static or non-static method.
 *  In the non-static case, the method handle type includes an explicit
 *  receiver argument, prepended before any other arguments.
 *  In the method handle's type, the initial receiver argument is typed
 *  according to the class under which the method was initially requested.
 *  (E.g., if a non-static method handle is obtained via ldc,
 *  the type of the receiver is the class named in the constant pool entry.)
 *  
 *  Method handle constants are subject to the same link-time access checks
 *  their corresponding bytecode instructions, and the ldc instruction
 *  will throw corresponding linkage errors if the bytecode behaviors would
 *  throw such errors.
 *  
 *  As a corollary of this, access to protected members is restricted
 *  to receivers only of the accessing class, or one of its subclasses,
 *  and the accessing class must in turn be a subclass (or package sibling)
 *  of the protected member's defining class.
 *  If a method reference refers to a protected non-static method or field
 *  of a class outside the current package, the receiver argument will
 *  be narrowed to the type of the accessing class.
 *  
 *  When a method handle to a virtual method is invoked, the method is
 *  always looked up in the receiver (that is, the first argument).
 *  
 *  A non-virtual method handle to a specific virtual method implementation
 *  can also be created.  These do not perform virtual lookup based on
 *  receiver type.  Such a method handle simulates the effect of
 *  an invokespecial instruction to the same method.
 * 
 *  Usage examples
 *  Here are some examples of usage:
 *  
 * Object x, y; String s; int i;
 * MethodType mt; MethodHandle mh;
 * MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();
 * // mt is (char,char)String
 * mt = MethodType.methodType(String.class, char.class, char.class);
 * mh = lookup.findVirtual(String.class, "replace", mt);
 * s = (String) mh.invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');
 * // invokeExact(Ljava/lang/String;CC)Ljava/lang/String;
 * assertEquals(s, "nanny");
 * // weakly typed invocation (using MHs.invoke)
 * s = (String) mh.invokeWithArguments("sappy", 'p', 'v');
 * assertEquals(s, "savvy");
 * // mt is (Object[])List
 * mt = MethodType.methodType(java.util.List.class, Object[].class);
 * mh = lookup.findStatic(java.util.Arrays.class, "asList", mt);
 * assert(mh.isVarargsCollector());
 * x = mh.invoke("one", "two");
 * // invoke(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;
 * assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList("one","two"));
 * // mt is (Object,Object,Object)Object
 * mt = MethodType.genericMethodType(3);
 * mh = mh.asType(mt);
 * x = mh.invokeExact((Object)1, (Object)2, (Object)3);
 * // invokeExact(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
 * assertEquals(x, java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
 * // mt is ()int
 * mt = MethodType.methodType(int.class);
 * mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.util.List.class, "size", mt);
 * i = (int) mh.invokeExact(java.util.Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
 * // invokeExact(Ljava/util/List;)I
 * assert(i == 3);
 * mt = MethodType.methodType(void.class, String.class);
 * mh = lookup.findVirtual(java.io.PrintStream.class, "println", mt);
 * mh.invokeExact(System.out, "Hello, world.");
 * // invokeExact(Ljava/io/PrintStream;Ljava/lang/String;)V
 *  
 *  Each of the above calls to invokeExact or plain invoke
 *  generates a single invokevirtual instruction with
 *  the symbolic type descriptor indicated in the following comment.
 *  In these examples, the helper method assertEquals is assumed to
 *  be a method which calls Objects.equals
 *  on its arguments, and asserts that the result is true.
 * 
 *  Exceptions
 *  The methods invokeExact and invoke are declared
 *  to throw Throwable,
 *  which is to say that there is no static restriction on what a method handle
 *  can throw.  Since the JVM does not distinguish between checked
 *  and unchecked exceptions (other than by their class, of course),
 *  there is no particular effect on bytecode shape from ascribing
 *  checked exceptions to method handle invocations.  But in Java source
 *  code, methods which perform method handle calls must either explicitly
 *  throw Throwable, or else must catch all
 *  throwables locally, rethrowing only those which are legal in the context,
 *  and wrapping ones which are illegal.
 * 
 *  Signature polymorphism
 *  The unusual compilation and linkage behavior of
 *  invokeExact and plain invoke
 *  is referenced by the term signature polymorphism.
 *  As defined in the Java Language Specification,
 *  a signature polymorphic method is one which can operate with
 *  any of a wide range of call signatures and return types.
 *  
 *  In source code, a call to a signature polymorphic method will
 *  compile, regardless of the requested symbolic type descriptor.
 *  As usual, the Java compiler emits an invokevirtual
 *  instruction with the given symbolic type descriptor against the named method.
 *  The unusual part is that the symbolic type descriptor is derived from
 *  the actual argument and return types, not from the method declaration.
 *  
 *  When the JVM processes bytecode containing signature polymorphic calls,
 *  it will successfully link any such call, regardless of its symbolic type descriptor.
 *  (In order to retain type safety, the JVM will guard such calls with suitable
 *  dynamic type checks, as described elsewhere.)
 *  
 *  Bytecode generators, including the compiler back end, are required to emit
 *  untransformed symbolic type descriptors for these methods.
 *  Tools which determine symbolic linkage are required to accept such
 *  untransformed descriptors, without reporting linkage errors.
 * 
 *  Interoperation between method handles and the Core Reflection API
 *  Using factory methods in the Lookup API,
 *  any class member represented by a Core Reflection API object
 *  can be converted to a behaviorally equivalent method handle.
 *  For example, a reflective Method can
 *  be converted to a method handle using
 *  Lookup.unreflect.
 *  The resulting method handles generally provide more direct and efficient
 *  access to the underlying class members.
 *  
 *  As a special case,
 *  when the Core Reflection API is used to view the signature polymorphic
 *  methods invokeExact or plain invoke in this class,
 *  they appear as ordinary non-polymorphic methods.
 *  Their reflective appearance, as viewed by
 *  Class.getDeclaredMethod,
 *  is unaffected by their special status in this API.
 *  For example, Method.getModifiers
 *  will report exactly those modifier bits required for any similarly
 *  declared method, including in this case native and varargs bits.
 *  
 *  As with any reflected method, these methods (when reflected) may be
 *  invoked via java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke.
 *  However, such reflective calls do not result in method handle invocations.
 *  Such a call, if passed the required argument
 *  (a single one, of type Object[]), will ignore the argument and
 *  will throw an UnsupportedOperationException.
 *  
 *  Since invokevirtual instructions can natively
 *  invoke method handles under any symbolic type descriptor, this reflective view conflicts
 *  with the normal presentation of these methods via bytecodes.
 *  Thus, these two native methods, when reflectively viewed by
 *  Class.getDeclaredMethod, may be regarded as placeholders only.
 *  
 *  In order to obtain an invoker method for a particular type descriptor,
 *  use MethodHandles.exactInvoker,
 *  or MethodHandles.invoker.
 *  The Lookup.findVirtual
 *  API is also able to return a method handle
 *  to call invokeExact or plain invoke,
 *  for any specified type descriptor .
 * 
 *  Interoperation between method handles and Java generics
 *  A method handle can be obtained on a method, constructor, or field
 *  which is declared with Java generic types.
 *  As with the Core Reflection API, the type of the method handle
 *  will constructed from the erasure of the source-level type.
 *  When a method handle is invoked, the types of its arguments
 *  or the return value cast type may be generic types or type instances.
 *  If this occurs, the compiler will replace those
 *  types by their erasures when it constructs the symbolic type descriptor
 *  for the invokevirtual instruction.
 *  
 *  Method handles do not represent
 *  their function-like types in terms of Java parameterized (generic) types,
 *  because there are three mismatches between function-like types and parameterized
 *  Java types.
 *  
 *  Method types range over all possible arities,
 *  from no arguments to up to the  maximum number of allowed arguments.
 *  Generics are not variadic, and so cannot represent this.
 *  Method types can specify arguments of primitive types,
 *  which Java generic types cannot range over.
 *  Higher order functions over method handles (combinators) are
 *  often generic across a wide range of function types, including
 *  those of multiple arities.  It is impossible to represent such
 *  genericity with a Java type parameter.
 *  
 * 
 *  Arity limits
 *  The JVM imposes on all methods and constructors of any kind an absolute
 *  limit of 255 stacked arguments.  This limit can appear more restrictive
 *  in certain cases:
 *  
 *  A long or double argument counts (for purposes of arity limits) as two argument slots.
 *  A non-static method consumes an extra argument for the object on which the method is called.
 *  A constructor consumes an extra argument for the object which is being constructed.
 *  Since a method handle’s invoke method (or other signature-polymorphic method) is non-virtual,
 *      it consumes an extra argument for the method handle itself, in addition to any non-virtual receiver object.
 *  
 *  These limits imply that certain method handles cannot be created, solely because of the JVM limit on stacked arguments.
 *  For example, if a static JVM method accepts exactly 255 arguments, a method handle cannot be created for it.
 *  Attempts to create method handles with impossible method types lead to an IllegalArgumentException.
 *  In particular, a method handle’s type must not have an arity of the exact maximum 255.
