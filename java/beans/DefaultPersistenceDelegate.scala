/** The DefaultPersistenceDelegate is a concrete implementation of

 *  which no information is available. The DefaultPersistenceDelegate
 *  provides, version resilient, public API-based persistence for
 *  classes that follow the JavaBeansâ„¢ conventions without any class specific
 *  configuration.
 *  
 *  The key assumptions are that the class has a nullary constructor
 *  and that its state is accurately represented by matching pairs
 *  of "setter" and "getter" methods in the order they are returned
 *  by the Introspector.
 *  In addition to providing code-free persistence for JavaBeans,
 *  the DefaultPersistenceDelegate provides a convenient means
 *  to effect persistent storage for classes that have a constructor
 *  that, while not nullary, simply requires some property values
 *  as arguments.
