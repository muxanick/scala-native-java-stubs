/** This is a utility class that can be used by beans that support bound
 *  properties.  It manages a list of listeners and dispatches
 *  PropertyChangeEvents to them.  You can use an instance of this class
 *  as a member field of your bean and delegate these types of work to it.
 *  The PropertyChangeListener can be registered for all properties
 *  or for a property specified by name.
 *  
 *  Here is an example of PropertyChangeSupport usage that follows
 *  the rules and recommendations laid out in the JavaBeansâ„¢ specification:
 *  
 *  public class MyBean {
 *      private final PropertyChangeSupport pcs = new PropertyChangeSupport(this);
 * 
 *      public void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {
 *          this.pcs.addPropertyChangeListener(listener);
 *      }
 * 
 *      public void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {
 *          this.pcs.removePropertyChangeListener(listener);
 *      }
 * 
 *      private String value;
 * 
 *      public String getValue() {
 *          return this.value;
 *      }
 * 
 *      public void setValue(String newValue) {
 *          String oldValue = this.value;
 *          this.value = newValue;
 *          this.pcs.firePropertyChange("value", oldValue, newValue);
 *      }
 * 
 *      [...]
 *  }
 *  
 *  
 *  A PropertyChangeSupport instance is thread-safe.
 *  
 *  This class is serializable.  When it is serialized it will save
 *  (and restore) any listeners that are themselves serializable.  Any
 *  non-serializable listeners will be skipped during serialization.
