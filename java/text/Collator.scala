/** The Collator class performs locale-sensitive
 *  String comparison. You use this class to build
 *  searching and sorting routines for natural language text.
 * 
 *  
 *  Collator is an abstract base class. Subclasses
 *  implement specific collation strategies. One subclass,
 *  RuleBasedCollator, is currently provided with
 *  the Java Platform and is applicable to a wide set of languages. Other
 *  subclasses may be created to handle more specialized needs.
 * 
 *  
 *  Like other locale-sensitive classes, you can use the static
 *  factory method, getInstance, to obtain the appropriate
 *  Collator object for a given locale. You will only need
 *  to look at the subclasses of Collator if you need
 *  to understand the details of a particular collation strategy or
 *  if you need to modify that strategy.
 * 
 *  
 *  The following example shows how to compare two strings using
 *  the Collator for the default locale.
 *  
 *  
 *  // Compare two strings in the default locale
 *  Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();
 *  if( myCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") < 0 )
 *      System.out.println("abc is less than ABC");
 *  else
 *      System.out.println("abc is greater than or equal to ABC");
 *  
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *  You can set a Collator's strength property
 *  to determine the level of difference considered significant in
 *  comparisons. Four strengths are provided: PRIMARY,
 *  SECONDARY, TERTIARY, and IDENTICAL.
 *  The exact assignment of strengths to language features is
 *  locale dependant.  For example, in Czech, "e" and "f" are considered
 *  primary differences, while "e" and "Ä›" are secondary differences,
 *  "e" and "E" are tertiary differences and "e" and "e" are identical.
 *  The following shows how both case and accents could be ignored for
 *  US English.
 *  
 *  
 *  //Get the Collator for US English and set its strength to PRIMARY
 *  Collator usCollator = Collator.getInstance(Locale.US);
 *  usCollator.setStrength(Collator.PRIMARY);
 *  if( usCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") == 0 ) {
 *      System.out.println("Strings are equivalent");
 *  }
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  For comparing Strings exactly once, the compare
 *  method provides the best performance. When sorting a list of
 *  Strings however, it is generally necessary to compare each
 *  String multiple times. In this case, CollationKeys
 *  provide better performance. The CollationKey class converts
 *  a String to a series of bits that can be compared bitwise
 *  against other CollationKeys. A CollationKey is
 *  created by a Collator object for a given String.
 *  
 *  Note: CollationKeys from different
 *  Collators can not be compared. See the class description
 *  for CollationKey
 *  for an example using CollationKeys.
