// This class provides the method normalize which transforms Unicode
// text into an equivalent composed or decomposed form, allowing for easier
// sorting and searching of text.
// The normalize method supports the standard normalization forms
// described in
// 
// Unicode Standard Annex #15 â€” Unicode Normalization Forms.
// 
// Characters with accents or other adornments can be encoded in
// several different ways in Unicode.  For example, take the character A-acute.
// In Unicode, this can be encoded as a single character (the "composed" form):
//
// 
//      U+00C1    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE
//
// or as two separate characters (the "decomposed" form):
//
// 
//      U+0041    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
//      U+0301    COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT
//
// To a user of your program, however, both of these sequences should be
// treated as the same "user-level" character "A with acute accent".  When you
// are searching or comparing text, you must ensure that these two sequences are
// treated as equivalent.  In addition, you must handle characters with more than
// one accent. Sometimes the order of a character's combining accents is
// significant, while in other cases accent sequences in different orders are
// really equivalent.
// 
// Similarly, the string "ffi" can be encoded as three separate letters:
//
// 
//      U+0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
//      U+0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
//      U+0069    LATIN SMALL LETTER I
//
// or as the single character
//
// 
//      U+FB03    LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI
//
// The ffi ligature is not a distinct semantic character, and strictly speaking
// it shouldn't be in Unicode at all, but it was included for compatibility
// with existing character sets that already provided it.  The Unicode standard
// identifies such characters by giving them "compatibility" decompositions
// into the corresponding semantic characters.  When sorting and searching, you
// will often want to use these mappings.
// 
// The normalize method helps solve these problems by transforming
// text into the canonical composed and decomposed forms as shown in the first
// example above. In addition, you can have it perform compatibility
// decompositions so that you can treat compatibility characters the same as
// their equivalents.
// Finally, the normalize method rearranges accents into the
// proper canonical order, so that you do not have to worry about accent
// rearrangement on your own.
// 
// The W3C generally recommends to exchange texts in NFC.
// Note also that most legacy character encodings use only precomposed forms and
// often do not encode any combining marks by themselves. For conversion to such
// character encodings the Unicode text needs to be normalized to NFC.
// For more usage examples, see the Unicode Standard Annex.
