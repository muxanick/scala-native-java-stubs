/** An entry in an access control list (ACL).
 * 
 *   The ACL entry represented by this class is based on the ACL model
 *  specified in RFCÂ 3530:
 *  Network File System (NFS) version 4 Protocol. Each entry has four
 *  components as follows:
 * 
 *  
 *      The type component determines if the entry
 *     grants or denies access. 
 * 
 *      The principal component, sometimes called the
 *     "who" component, is a UserPrincipal corresponding to the identity
 *     that the entry grants or denies access
 *     
 * 
 *      The permissions component is a set of
 *     permissions
 *     
 * 
 *      The flags component is a set of flags to indicate how entries are inherited and propagated 
 *  
 * 
 *   ACL entries are created using an associated AclEntry.Builder object by
 *  invoking its build method.
 * 
 *   ACL entries are immutable and are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 *  threads.
