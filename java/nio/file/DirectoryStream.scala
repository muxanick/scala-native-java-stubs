/** An object to iterate over the entries in a directory. A directory stream
 *  allows for the convenient use of the for-each construct to iterate over a
 *  directory.
 * 
 *    While DirectoryStream extends Iterable, it is not a
 *  general-purpose Iterable as it supports only a single Iterator; invoking the iterator method to obtain a second
 *  or subsequent iterator throws IllegalStateException. 
 * 
 *   An important property of the directory stream's Iterator is that
 *  its hasNext method is guaranteed to read-ahead by
 *  at least one element. If hasNext method returns true, and is
 *  followed by a call to the next method, it is guaranteed that the
 *  next method will not throw an exception due to an I/O error, or
 *  because the stream has been closed. The Iterator does
 *  not support the remove operation.
 * 
 *   A DirectoryStream is opened upon creation and is closed by
 *  invoking the close method. Closing a directory stream releases any
 *  resources associated with the stream. Failure to close the stream may result
 *  in a resource leak. The try-with-resources statement provides a useful
 *  construct to ensure that the stream is closed:
 *  
 *    Path dir = ...
 *    try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir)) {
 *        for (Path entry: stream) {
 *            ...
 *        }
 *    }
 *  
 * 
 *   Once a directory stream is closed, then further access to the directory,
 *  using the Iterator, behaves as if the end of stream has been reached.
 *  Due to read-ahead, the Iterator may return one or more elements
 *  after the directory stream has been closed. Once these buffered elements
 *  have been read, then subsequent calls to the hasNext method returns
 *  false, and subsequent calls to the next method will throw
 *  NoSuchElementException.
 * 
 *   A directory stream is not required to be asynchronously closeable.
 *  If a thread is blocked on the directory stream's iterator reading from the
 *  directory, and another thread invokes the close method, then the
 *  second thread may block until the read operation is complete.
 * 
 *   If an I/O error is encountered when accessing the directory then it
 *  causes the Iterator's hasNext or next methods to
 *  throw DirectoryIteratorException with the IOException as the
 *  cause. As stated above, the hasNext method is guaranteed to
 *  read-ahead by at least one element. This means that if hasNext method
 *  returns true, and is followed by a call to the next method,
 *  then it is guaranteed that the next method will not fail with a
 *  DirectoryIteratorException.
 * 
 *   The elements returned by the iterator are in no specific order. Some file
 *  systems maintain special links to the directory itself and the directory's
 *  parent directory. Entries representing these links are not returned by the
 *  iterator.
 * 
 *   The iterator is weakly consistent. It is thread safe but does not
 *  freeze the directory while iterating, so it may (or may not) reflect updates
 *  to the directory that occur after the DirectoryStream is created.
 * 
 *   Usage Examples:
 *  Suppose we want a list of the source files in a directory. This example uses
 *  both the for-each and try-with-resources constructs.
 *  
 *    List<Path> listSourceFiles(Path dir) throws IOException {
 *        List<Path> result = new ArrayList<>();
 *        try (DirectoryStream<Path> stream = Files.newDirectoryStream(dir, "*.{c,h,cpp,hpp,java}")) {
 *            for (Path entry: stream) {
 *                result.add(entry);
 *            }
 *        } catch (DirectoryIteratorException ex) {
 *            // I/O error encounted during the iteration, the cause is an IOException
 *            throw ex.getCause();
 *        }
 *        return result;
 *    }
 *
