import java.lang.{AutoCloseable, Object}

// A token representing a lock on a region of a file.
//
//  A file-lock object is created each time a lock is acquired on a file via
// one of the lock or tryLock methods of the
// FileChannel class, or the lock
// or tryLock
// methods of the AsynchronousFileChannel class.
//
//  A file-lock object is initially valid.  It remains valid until the lock
// is released by invoking the release method, by closing the
// channel that was used to acquire it, or by the termination of the Java
// virtual machine, whichever comes first.  The validity of a lock may be
// tested by invoking its isValid method.
//
//  A file lock is either exclusive or shared.  A shared lock
// prevents other concurrently-running programs from acquiring an overlapping
// exclusive lock, but does allow them to acquire overlapping shared locks.  An
// exclusive lock prevents other programs from acquiring an overlapping lock of
// either type.  Once it is released, a lock has no further effect on the locks
// that may be acquired by other programs.
//
//  Whether a lock is exclusive or shared may be determined by invoking its
// isShared method.  Some platforms do not support shared
// locks, in which case a request for a shared lock is automatically converted
// into a request for an exclusive lock.
//
//  The locks held on a particular file by a single Java virtual machine do
// not overlap.  The overlaps method may be used to test
// whether a candidate lock range overlaps an existing lock.
//
//  A file-lock object records the file channel upon whose file the lock is
// held, the type and validity of the lock, and the position and size of the
// locked region.  Only the validity of a lock is subject to change over time;
// all other aspects of a lock's state are immutable.
//
//  File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
// They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
// threads within the same virtual machine.
//
//  File-lock objects are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
//
//
//  Platform dependencies 
//
//  This file-locking API is intended to map directly to the native locking
// facility of the underlying operating system.  Thus the locks held on a file
// should be visible to all programs that have access to the file, regardless
// of the language in which those programs are written.
//
//  Whether or not a lock actually prevents another program from accessing
// the content of the locked region is system-dependent and therefore
// unspecified.  The native file-locking facilities of some systems are merely
// advisory, meaning that programs must cooperatively observe a known
// locking protocol in order to guarantee data integrity.  On other systems
// native file locks are mandatory, meaning that if one program locks a
// region of a file then other programs are actually prevented from accessing
// that region in a way that would violate the lock.  On yet other systems,
// whether native file locks are advisory or mandatory is configurable on a
// per-file basis.  To ensure consistent and correct behavior across platforms,
// it is strongly recommended that the locks provided by this API be used as if
// they were advisory locks.
//
//  On some systems, acquiring a mandatory lock on a region of a file
// prevents that region from being mapped into memory, and vice versa.  Programs that combine
// locking and mapping should be prepared for this combination to fail.
//
//  On some systems, closing a channel releases all locks held by the Java
// virtual machine on the underlying file regardless of whether the locks were
// acquired via that channel or via another channel open on the same file.  It
// is strongly recommended that, within a program, a unique channel be used to
// acquire all locks on any given file.
//
//  Some network filesystems permit file locking to be used with
// memory-mapped files only when the locked regions are page-aligned and a
// whole multiple of the underlying hardware's page size.  Some network
// filesystems do not implement file locks on regions that extend past a
// certain position, often 230 or 231.  In general, great
// care should be taken when locking files that reside on network filesystems.
