/** A multiplexor of SelectableChannel objects.
 * 
 *   A selector may be created by invoking the open method of
 *  this class, which will use the system's default selector provider to
 *  create a new selector.  A selector may also be created by invoking the
 *  openSelector
 *  method of a custom selector provider.  A selector remains open until it is
 *  closed via its close method.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   A selectable channel's registration with a selector is represented by a
 *  SelectionKey object.  A selector maintains three sets of selection
 *  keys:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *     The key set contains the keys representing the current
 *    channel registrations of this selector.  This set is returned by the
 *    keys method. 
 * 
 *     The selected-key set is the set of keys such that each
 *    key's channel was detected to be ready for at least one of the operations
 *    identified in the key's interest set during a prior selection operation.
 *    This set is returned by the selectedKeys method.
 *    The selected-key set is always a subset of the key set. 
 * 
 *     The cancelled-key set is the set of keys that have been
 *    cancelled but whose channels have not yet been deregistered.  This set is
 *    not directly accessible.  The cancelled-key set is always a subset of the
 *    key set. 
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   All three sets are empty in a newly-created selector.
 * 
 *   A key is added to a selector's key set as a side effect of registering a
 *  channel via the channel's register method.  Cancelled keys are removed from the key set during
 *  selection operations.  The key set itself is not directly modifiable.
 * 
 *   A key is added to its selector's cancelled-key set when it is cancelled,
 *  whether by closing its channel or by invoking its cancel method.  Cancelling a key will cause its channel to be deregistered
 *  during the next selection operation, at which time the key will removed from
 *  all of the selector's key sets.
 * 
 *   Keys are added to the selected-key set by selection
 *  operations.  A key may be removed directly from the selected-key set by
 *  invoking the set's remove
 *  method or by invoking the remove method
 *  of an iterator obtained from the
 *  set.  Keys are never removed from the selected-key set in any other way;
 *  they are not, in particular, removed as a side effect of selection
 *  operations.  Keys may not be added directly to the selected-key set. 
 * 
 * 
 *  
 *  Selection
 * 
 *   During each selection operation, keys may be added to and removed from a
 *  selector's selected-key set and may be removed from its key and
 *  cancelled-key sets.  Selection is performed by the select(), select(long), and selectNow() methods, and involves three steps:
 *  
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *     Each key in the cancelled-key set is removed from each key set of
 *    which it is a member, and its channel is deregistered.  This step leaves
 *    the cancelled-key set empty. 
 * 
 *     The underlying operating system is queried for an update as to the
 *    readiness of each remaining channel to perform any of the operations
 *    identified by its key's interest set as of the moment that the selection
 *    operation began.  For a channel that is ready for at least one such
 *    operation, one of the following two actions is performed: 
 * 
 *    
 * 
 *       If the channel's key is not already in the selected-key set then
 *      it is added to that set and its ready-operation set is modified to
 *      identify exactly those operations for which the channel is now reported
 *      to be ready.  Any readiness information previously recorded in the ready
 *      set is discarded.  
 * 
 *       Otherwise the channel's key is already in the selected-key set,
 *      so its ready-operation set is modified to identify any new operations
 *      for which the channel is reported to be ready.  Any readiness
 *      information previously recorded in the ready set is preserved; in other
 *      words, the ready set returned by the underlying system is
 *      bitwise-disjoined into the key's current ready set. 
 * 
 *    
 * 
 *    If all of the keys in the key set at the start of this step have empty
 *    interest sets then neither the selected-key set nor any of the keys'
 *    ready-operation sets will be updated.
 * 
 *     If any keys were added to the cancelled-key set while step (2) was
 *    in progress then they are processed as in step (1). 
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Whether or not a selection operation blocks to wait for one or more
 *  channels to become ready, and if so for how long, is the only essential
 *  difference between the three selection methods. 
 * 
 * 
 *  Concurrency
 * 
 *   Selectors are themselves safe for use by multiple concurrent threads;
 *  their key sets, however, are not.
 * 
 *   The selection operations synchronize on the selector itself, on the key
 *  set, and on the selected-key set, in that order.  They also synchronize on
 *  the cancelled-key set during steps (1) and (3) above.
 * 
 *   Changes made to the interest sets of a selector's keys while a
 *  selection operation is in progress have no effect upon that operation; they
 *  will be seen by the next selection operation.
 * 
 *   Keys may be cancelled and channels may be closed at any time.  Hence the
 *  presence of a key in one or more of a selector's key sets does not imply
 *  that the key is valid or that its channel is open.  Application code should
 *  be careful to synchronize and check these conditions as necessary if there
 *  is any possibility that another thread will cancel a key or close a channel.
 * 
 *   A thread blocked in one of the select() or select(long) methods may be interrupted by some other thread in one of
 *  three ways:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *     By invoking the selector's wakeup method,
 *    
 * 
 *     By invoking the selector's close method, or
 *    
 * 
 *     By invoking the blocked thread's interrupt method, in which case its
 *    interrupt status will be set and the selector's wakeup
 *    method will be invoked. 
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The close method synchronizes on the selector and all
 *  three key sets in the same order as in a selection operation.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   A selector's key and selected-key sets are not, in general, safe for use
 *  by multiple concurrent threads.  If such a thread might modify one of these
 *  sets directly then access should be controlled by synchronizing on the set
 *  itself.  The iterators returned by these sets' iterator methods are fail-fast: If the set
 *  is modified after the iterator is created, in any way except by invoking the
 *  iterator's own remove method, then a
 *  ConcurrentModificationException will be thrown.
