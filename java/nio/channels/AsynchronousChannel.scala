/** A channel that supports asynchronous I/O operations. Asynchronous I/O
 *  operations will usually take one of two forms:
 * 
 *  
 *  Future<V> operation(...)
 *  void operation(... A attachment, CompletionHandler<V,? super A> handler)
 *  
 * 
 *  where operation is the name of the I/O operation (read or write for
 *  example), V is the result type of the I/O operation, and A is
 *  the type of an object attached to the I/O operation to provide context when
 *  consuming the result. The attachment is important for cases where a
 *  state-less CompletionHandler is used to consume the result
 *  of many I/O operations.
 * 
 *   In the first form, the methods defined by the Future
 *  interface may be used to check if the operation has completed, wait for its
 *  completion, and to retrieve the result. In the second form, a CompletionHandler is invoked to consume the result of the I/O operation when
 *  it completes or fails.
 * 
 *   A channel that implements this interface is asynchronously
 *  closeable: If an I/O operation is outstanding on the channel and the
 *  channel's close method is invoked, then the I/O operation
 *  fails with the exception AsynchronousCloseException.
 * 
 *   Asynchronous channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
 *  Some channel implementations may support concurrent reading and writing, but
 *  may not allow more than one read and one write operation to be outstanding at
 *  any given time.
 * 
 *  Cancellation
 * 
 *   The Future interface defines the cancel
 *  method to cancel execution. This causes all threads waiting on the result of
 *  the I/O operation to throw CancellationException.
 *  Whether the underlying I/O operation can be cancelled is highly implementation
 *  specific and therefore not specified. Where cancellation leaves the channel,
 *  or the entity to which it is connected, in an inconsistent state, then the
 *  channel is put into an implementation specific error state that
 *  prevents further attempts to initiate I/O operations that are similar
 *  to the operation that was cancelled. For example, if a read operation is
 *  cancelled but the implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been
 *  read from the channel then it puts the channel into an error state; further
 *  attempts to initiate a read operation cause an unspecified runtime
 *  exception to be thrown. Similarly, if a write operation is cancelled but the
 *  implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written to the
 *  channel then subsequent attempts to initiate a write will fail with
 *  an unspecified runtime exception.
 * 
 *   Where the cancel method is invoked with the mayInterruptIfRunning parameter set to true then the I/O operation
 *  may be interrupted by closing the channel. In that case all threads waiting
 *  on the result of the I/O operation throw CancellationException and
 *  any other I/O operations outstanding on the channel complete with the
 *  exception AsynchronousCloseException.
 * 
 *   Where the cancel method is invoked to cancel read or write
 *  operations then it is recommended that all buffers used in the I/O operations
 *  be discarded or care taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while
 *  the channel remains open.
