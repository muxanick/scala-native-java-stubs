/** An interpreter for printf-style format strings.  This class provides support
 *  for layout justification and alignment, common formats for numeric, string,
 *  and date/time data, and locale-specific output.  Common Java types such as
 *  byte, BigDecimal, and Calendar
 *  are supported.  Limited formatting customization for arbitrary user types is
 *  provided through the Formattable interface.
 * 
 *   Formatters are not necessarily safe for multithreaded access.  Thread
 *  safety is optional and is the responsibility of users of methods in this
 *  class.
 * 
 *   Formatted printing for the Java language is heavily inspired by C's
 *  printf.  Although the format strings are similar to C, some
 *  customizations have been made to accommodate the Java language and exploit
 *  some of its features.  Also, Java formatting is more strict than C's; for
 *  example, if a conversion is incompatible with a flag, an exception will be
 *  thrown.  In C inapplicable flags are silently ignored.  The format strings
 *  are thus intended to be recognizable to C programmers but not necessarily
 *  completely compatible with those in C.
 * 
 *   Examples of expected usage:
 * 
 *  
 *    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
 *    // Send all output to the Appendable object sb
 *    Formatter formatter = new Formatter(sb, Locale.US);
 * 
 *    // Explicit argument indices may be used to re-order output.
 *    formatter.format("%4$2s %3$2s %2$2s %1$2s", "a", "b", "c", "d")
 *    // -> " d  c  b  a"
 * 
 *    // Optional locale as the first argument can be used to get
 *    // locale-specific formatting of numbers.  The precision and width can be
 *    // given to round and align the value.
 *    formatter.format(Locale.FRANCE, "e = %+10.4f", Math.E);
 *    // -> "e =    +2,7183"
 * 
 *    // The '(' numeric flag may be used to format negative numbers with
 *    // parentheses rather than a minus sign.  Group separators are
 *    // automatically inserted.
 *    formatter.format("Amount gained or lost since last statement: $ %(,.2f",
 *                     balanceDelta);
 *    // -> "Amount gained or lost since last statement: $ (6,217.58)"
 *  
 * 
 *   Convenience methods for common formatting requests exist as illustrated
 *  by the following invocations:
 * 
 *  
 *    // Writes a formatted string to System.out.
 *    System.out.format("Local time: %tT", Calendar.getInstance());
 *    // -> "Local time: 13:34:18"
 * 
 *    // Writes formatted output to System.err.
 *    System.err.printf("Unable to open file '%1$s': %2$s",
 *                      fileName, exception.getMessage());
 *    // -> "Unable to open file 'food': No such file or directory"
 *  
 * 
 *   Like C's sprintf(3), Strings may be formatted using the static
 *  method String.format:
 * 
 *  
 *    // Format a string containing a date.
 *    import java.util.Calendar;
 *    import java.util.GregorianCalendar;
 *    import static java.util.Calendar.*;
 * 
 *    Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar(1995, MAY, 23);
 *    String s = String.format("Duke's Birthday: %1$tb %1$te, %1$tY", c);
 *    // -> s == "Duke's Birthday: May 23, 1995"
 *  
 * 
 *  Organization
 * 
 *   This specification is divided into two sections.  The first section, Summary, covers the basic formatting concepts.  This
 *  section is intended for users who want to get started quickly and are
 *  familiar with formatted printing in other programming languages.  The second
 *  section, Details, covers the specific implementation
 *  details.  It is intended for users who want more precise specification of
 *  formatting behavior.
 * 
 *  Summary
 * 
 *   This section is intended to provide a brief overview of formatting
 *  concepts.  For precise behavioral details, refer to the Details section.
 * 
 *  Format String Syntax
 * 
 *   Every method which produces formatted output requires a format
 *  string and an argument list.  The format string is a String which may contain fixed text and one or more embedded format
 *  specifiers.  Consider the following example:
 * 
 *  
 *    Calendar c = ...;
 *    String s = String.format("Duke's Birthday: %1$tm %1$te,%1$tY", c);
 *  
 * 
 *  This format string is the first argument to the format method.  It
 *  contains three format specifiers "%1$tm", "%1$te", and
 *  "%1$tY" which indicate how the arguments should be processed and
 *  where they should be inserted in the text.  The remaining portions of the
 *  format string are fixed text including "Dukes Birthday: " and any
 *  other spaces or punctuation.
 * 
 *  The argument list consists of all arguments passed to the method after the
 *  format string.  In the above example, the argument list is of size one and
 *  consists of the Calendar object c.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The format specifiers for general, character, and numeric types have
 *  the following syntax:
 * 
 *  
 *    %[argument_index$][flags][width][.precision]conversion
 *  
 * 
 *   The optional argument_index is a decimal integer indicating the
 *  position of the argument in the argument list.  The first argument is
 *  referenced by "1$", the second by "2$", etc.
 * 
 *   The optional flags is a set of characters that modify the output
 *  format.  The set of valid flags depends on the conversion.
 * 
 *   The optional width is a positive decimal integer indicating
 *  the minimum number of characters to be written to the output.
 * 
 *   The optional precision is a non-negative decimal integer usually
 *  used to restrict the number of characters.  The specific behavior depends on
 *  the conversion.
 * 
 *   The required conversion is a character indicating how the
 *  argument should be formatted.  The set of valid conversions for a given
 *  argument depends on the argument's data type.
 * 
 *   The format specifiers for types which are used to represents dates and
 *  times have the following syntax:
 * 
 *  
 *    %[argument_index$][flags][width]conversion
 *  
 * 
 *   The optional argument_index, flags and width are
 *  defined as above.
 * 
 *   The required conversion is a two character sequence.  The first
 *  character is 't' or 'T'.  The second character indicates
 *  the format to be used.  These characters are similar to but not completely
 *  identical to those defined by GNU date and POSIX
 *  strftime(3c).
 * 
 *   The format specifiers which do not correspond to arguments have the
 *  following syntax:
 * 
 *  
 *    %[flags][width]conversion
 *  
 * 
 *   The optional flags and width is defined as above.
 * 
 *   The required conversion is a character indicating content to be
 *  inserted in the output.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Conversions 
 * 
 *   Conversions are divided into the following categories:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   General - may be applied to any argument
 *  type
 * 
 *   Character - may be applied to basic types which represent
 *  Unicode characters: char, Character, byte, Byte, short, and Short. This conversion may also be
 *  applied to the types int and Integer when Character.isValidCodePoint(int) returns true
 * 
 *   Numeric
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Integral - may be applied to Java integral types: byte,
 *  Byte, short, Short, int and Integer, long, Long, and BigInteger (but not char or Character)
 * 
 *  Floating Point - may be applied to Java floating-point types:
 *  float, Float, double, Double, and BigDecimal
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Date/Time - may be applied to Java types which are capable of
 *  encoding a date or time: long, Long, Calendar,
 *  Date and TemporalAccessor
 * 
 *   Percent - produces a literal '%'
 *  ('\u0025')
 * 
 *   Line Separator - produces the platform-specific line separator
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The following table summarizes the supported conversions.  Conversions
 *  denoted by an upper-case character (i.e. 'B', 'H',
 *  'S', 'C', 'X', 'E', 'G',
 *  'A', and 'T') are the same as those for the corresponding
 *  lower-case conversion characters except that the result is converted to
 *  upper case according to the rules of the prevailing Locale.  The result is equivalent to the following invocation of String.toUpperCase()
 * 
 *  
 *     out.toUpperCase() 
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Conversion
 *       Argument Category
 *       Description
 * 
 *   'b', 'B'
 *       general
 *       If the argument arg is null, then the result is
 *      "false".  If arg is a boolean or Boolean, then the result is the string returned by String.valueOf(arg).  Otherwise, the result is
 *      "true".
 * 
 *   'h', 'H'
 *       general
 *       If the argument arg is null, then the result is
 *      "null".  Otherwise, the result is obtained by invoking
 *      Integer.toHexString(arg.hashCode()).
 * 
 *   's', 'S'
 *       general
 *       If the argument arg is null, then the result is
 *      "null".  If arg implements Formattable, then
 *      arg.formatTo is invoked. Otherwise, the
 *      result is obtained by invoking arg.toString().
 * 
 *  'c', 'C'
 *       character
 *       The result is a Unicode character
 * 
 *  'd'
 *       integral
 *       The result is formatted as a decimal integer
 * 
 *  'o'
 *       integral
 *       The result is formatted as an octal integer
 * 
 *  'x', 'X'
 *       integral
 *       The result is formatted as a hexadecimal integer
 * 
 *  'e', 'E'

 *      scientific notation
 * 
 *  'f'
 *       floating point
 *       The result is formatted as a decimal number
 * 
 *  'g', 'G'
 *       floating point
 *       The result is formatted using computerized scientific notation or
 *      decimal format, depending on the precision and the value after rounding.
 * 
 *  'a', 'A'
 *       floating point
 *       The result is formatted as a hexadecimal floating-point number with
 *      a significand and an exponent. This conversion is not supported
 *      for the BigDecimal type despite the latter's being in the
 *      floating point argument category.
 * 
 *  't', 'T'
 *       date/time
 *       Prefix for date and time conversion characters.  See Date/Time Conversions.
 * 
 *  '%'
 *       percent
 *       The result is a literal '%' ('\u0025')
 * 
 *  'n'
 *       line separator
 *       The result is the platform-specific line separator
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Any characters not explicitly defined as conversions are illegal and are
 *  reserved for future extensions.
 * 
 *  Date/Time Conversions
 * 
 *   The following date and time conversion suffix characters are defined for
 *  the 't' and 'T' conversions.  The types are similar to but
 *  not completely identical to those defined by GNU date and POSIX
 *  strftime(3c).  Additional conversion types are provided to access
 *  Java-specific functionality (e.g. 'L' for milliseconds within the
 *  second).
 * 
 *   The following conversion characters are used for formatting times:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   'H'
 *       Hour of the day for the 24-hour clock, formatted as two digits with
 *      a leading zero as necessary i.e. 00 - 23.
 * 
 *  'I'
 *       Hour for the 12-hour clock, formatted as two digits with a leading
 *      zero as necessary, i.e.  01 - 12.
 * 
 *  'k'
 *       Hour of the day for the 24-hour clock, i.e. 0 - 23.
 * 
 *  'l'
 *       Hour for the 12-hour clock, i.e. 1 - 12.
 * 
 *  'M'
 *       Minute within the hour formatted as two digits with a leading zero
 *      as necessary, i.e.  00 - 59.
 * 
 *  'S'
 *       Seconds within the minute, formatted as two digits with a leading
 *      zero as necessary, i.e. 00 - 60 ("60" is a special
 *      value required to support leap seconds).
 * 
 *  'L'
 *       Millisecond within the second formatted as three digits with
 *      leading zeros as necessary, i.e. 000 - 999.
 * 
 *  'N'
 *       Nanosecond within the second, formatted as nine digits with leading
 *      zeros as necessary, i.e. 000000000 - 999999999.
 * 
 *  'p'
 *       Locale-specific morning or afternoon marker
 *      in lower case, e.g."am" or "pm". Use of the conversion
 *      prefix 'T' forces this output to upper case.
 * 
 *  'z'
 *       RFC 822
 *      style numeric time zone offset from GMT, e.g. -0800.  This
 *      value will be adjusted as necessary for Daylight Saving Time.  For
 *      long, Long, and Date the time zone used is
 *      the default time zone for this
 *      instance of the Java virtual machine.
 * 
 *  'Z'
 *       A string representing the abbreviation for the time zone.  This
 *      value will be adjusted as necessary for Daylight Saving Time.  For
 *      long, Long, and Date the  time zone used is
 *      the default time zone for this
 *      instance of the Java virtual machine.  The Formatter's locale will
 *      supersede the locale of the argument (if any).
 * 
 *  's'
 *       Seconds since the beginning of the epoch starting at 1 January 1970
 *      00:00:00 UTC, i.e. Long.MIN_VALUE/1000 to
 *      Long.MAX_VALUE/1000.
 * 
 *  'Q'
 *       Milliseconds since the beginning of the epoch starting at 1 January
 *      1970 00:00:00 UTC, i.e. Long.MIN_VALUE to
 *      Long.MAX_VALUE.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The following conversion characters are used for formatting dates:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  'B'
 *       Locale-specific full month name, e.g. "January", "February".
 * 
 *  'b'
 *       Locale-specific abbreviated month name,
 *      e.g. "Jan", "Feb".
 * 
 *  'h'
 *       Same as 'b'.
 * 
 *  'A'
 *       Locale-specific full name of the day of the week,
 *      e.g. "Sunday", "Monday"
 * 
 *  'a'
 *       Locale-specific short name of the day of the week,
 *      e.g. "Sun", "Mon"
 * 
 *  'C'
 *       Four-digit year divided by 100, formatted as two digits
 *      with leading zero as necessary, i.e. 00 - 99
 * 
 *  'Y'
 *       Year, formatted as at least four digits with leading zeros as
 *      necessary, e.g. 0092 equals 92 CE for the Gregorian
 *      calendar.
 * 
 *  'y'
 *       Last two digits of the year, formatted with leading zeros as
 *      necessary, i.e. 00 - 99.
 * 
 *  'j'
 *       Day of year, formatted as three digits with leading zeros as
 *      necessary, e.g. 001 - 366 for the Gregorian calendar.
 * 
 *  'm'
 *       Month, formatted as two digits with leading zeros as necessary,
 *      i.e. 01 - 13.
 * 
 *  'd'
 *       Day of month, formatted as two digits with leading zeros as
 *      necessary, i.e. 01 - 31
 * 
 *  'e'
 *       Day of month, formatted as two digits, i.e. 1 - 31.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The following conversion characters are used for formatting common
 *  date/time compositions.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  'R'
 *       Time formatted for the 24-hour clock as "%tH:%tM"
 * 
 *  'T'
 *       Time formatted for the 24-hour clock as "%tH:%tM:%tS".
 * 
 *  'r'
 *       Time formatted for the 12-hour clock as "%tI:%tM:%tS %Tp".
 *      The location of the morning or afternoon marker ('%Tp') may be
 *      locale-dependent.
 * 
 *  'D'
 *       Date formatted as "%tm/%td/%ty".
 * 
 *  'F'
 *       ISO 8601
 *      complete date formatted as "%tY-%tm-%td".
 * 
 *  'c'
 *       Date and time formatted as "%ta %tb %td %tT %tZ %tY",
 *      e.g. "Sun Jul 20 16:17:00 EDT 1969".
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Any characters not explicitly defined as date/time conversion suffixes
 *  are illegal and are reserved for future extensions.
 * 
 *   Flags 
 * 
 *   The following table summarizes the supported flags.  y means the
 *  flag is supported for the indicated argument types.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Flag  General
 *       Character  Integral
 *       Floating Point
 *       Date/Time
 *       Description
 * 
 *   '-'  y
 *       y
 *       y
 *       y
 *       y
 *       The result will be left-justified.
 * 
 *   '#'  y1
 *       -
 *       y3
 *       y
 *       -
 *       The result should use a conversion-dependent alternate form
 * 
 *   '+'  -
 *       -
 *       y4
 *       y
 *       -
 *       The result will always include a sign
 * 
 *   '  '  -
 *       -
 *       y4
 *       y
 *       -
 *       The result will include a leading space for positive values
 * 
 *   '0'  -
 *       -
 *       y
 *       y
 *       -
 *       The result will be zero-padded
 * 
 *   ','  -
 *       -
 *       y2
 *       y5
 *       -
 *       The result will include locale-specific grouping separators
 * 
 *   '('  -
 *       -
 *       y4
 *       y5
 *       -
 *       The result will enclose negative numbers in parentheses
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   1 Depends on the definition of Formattable.
 * 
 *   2 For 'd' conversion only.
 * 
 *   3 For 'o', 'x', and 'X'
 *  conversions only.
 * 
 *   4 For 'd', 'o', 'x', and
 *  'X' conversions applied to BigInteger
 *  or 'd' applied to byte, Byte, short, Short, int and Integer, long, and Long.
 * 
 *   5 For 'e', 'E', 'f',
 *  'g', and 'G' conversions only.
 * 
 *   Any characters not explicitly defined as flags are illegal and are
 *  reserved for future extensions.
 * 
 *   Width 
 * 
 *   The width is the minimum number of characters to be written to the
 *  output.  For the line separator conversion, width is not applicable; if it
 *  is provided, an exception will be thrown.
 * 
 *   Precision 
 * 
 *   For general argument types, the precision is the maximum number of
 *  characters to be written to the output.
 * 
 *   For the floating-point conversions 'a', 'A', 'e',
 *  'E', and 'f' the precision is the number of digits after the
 *  radix point.  If the conversion is 'g' or 'G', then the
 *  precision is the total number of digits in the resulting magnitude after
 *  rounding.
 * 
 *   For character, integral, and date/time argument types and the percent
 *  and line separator conversions, the precision is not applicable; if a
 *  precision is provided, an exception will be thrown.
 * 
 *   Argument Index 
 * 
 *   The argument index is a decimal integer indicating the position of the
 *  argument in the argument list.  The first argument is referenced by
 *  "1$", the second by "2$", etc.
 * 
 *   Another way to reference arguments by position is to use the
 *  '<' ('\u003c') flag, which causes the argument for
 *  the previous format specifier to be re-used.  For example, the following two
 *  statements would produce identical strings:
 * 
 *  
 *    Calendar c = ...;
 *    String s1 = String.format("Duke's Birthday: %1$tm %1$te,%1$tY", c);
 * 
 *    String s2 = String.format("Duke's Birthday: %1$tm %<te,%<tY", c);
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *  Details
 * 
 *   This section is intended to provide behavioral details for formatting,
 *  including conditions and exceptions, supported data types, localization, and
 *  interactions between flags, conversions, and data types.  For an overview of
 *  formatting concepts, refer to the Summary
 * 
 *   Any characters not explicitly defined as conversions, date/time
 *  conversion suffixes, or flags are illegal and are reserved for
 *  future extensions.  Use of such a character in a format string will
 *  cause an UnknownFormatConversionException or UnknownFormatFlagsException to be thrown.
 * 
 *   If the format specifier contains a width or precision with an invalid
 *  value or which is otherwise unsupported, then a IllegalFormatWidthException or IllegalFormatPrecisionException
 *  respectively will be thrown.
 * 
 *   If a format specifier contains a conversion character that is not
 *  applicable to the corresponding argument, then an IllegalFormatConversionException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   All specified exceptions may be thrown by any of the format
 *  methods of Formatter as well as by any format convenience
 *  methods such as String.format and
 *  PrintStream.printf.
 * 
 *   Conversions denoted by an upper-case character (i.e. 'B',
 *  'H', 'S', 'C', 'X', 'E',
 *  'G', 'A', and 'T') are the same as those for the
 *  corresponding lower-case conversion characters except that the result is
 *  converted to upper case according to the rules of the prevailing Locale.  The result is equivalent to the following
 *  invocation of String.toUpperCase()
 * 
 *  
 *     out.toUpperCase() 
 * 
 *  General
 * 
 *   The following general conversions may be applied to any argument type:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   'b'
 *       '\u0062'
 *       Produces either "true" or "false" as returned by
 *      Boolean.toString(boolean).
 * 
 *       If the argument is null, then the result is
 *      "false".  If the argument is a boolean or Boolean, then the result is the string returned by String.valueOf().  Otherwise, the result is
 *      "true".
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given, then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'B'
 *       '\u0042'
 *       The upper-case variant of 'b'.
 * 
 *   'h'
 *       '\u0068'
 *       Produces a string representing the hash code value of the object.
 * 
 *       If the argument, arg is null, then the
 *      result is "null".  Otherwise, the result is obtained
 *      by invoking Integer.toHexString(arg.hashCode()).
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given, then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'H'
 *       '\u0048'
 *       The upper-case variant of 'h'.
 * 
 *   's'
 *       '\u0073'
 *       Produces a string.
 * 
 *       If the argument is null, then the result is
 *      "null".  If the argument implements Formattable, then
 *      its formatTo method is invoked.
 *      Otherwise, the result is obtained by invoking the argument's
 *      toString() method.
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given and the argument is not a Formattable , then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException
 *      will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'S'
 *       '\u0053'
 *       The upper-case variant of 's'.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The following flags apply to general conversions:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   '-'
 *       '\u002d'
 *       Left justifies the output.  Spaces ('\u0020') will be
 *      added at the end of the converted value as required to fill the minimum
 *      width of the field.  If the width is not provided, then a MissingFormatWidthException will be thrown.  If this flag is not given
 *      then the output will be right-justified.
 * 
 *   '#'
 *       '\u0023'
 *       Requires the output use an alternate form.  The definition of the
 *      form is specified by the conversion.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The width is the minimum number of characters to
 *  be written to the
 *  output.  If the length of the converted value is less than the width then
 *  the output will be padded by '  ' ('\u0020')
 *  until the total number of characters equals the width.  The padding is on
 *  the left by default.  If the '-' flag is given, then the padding
 *  will be on the right.  If the width is not specified then there is no
 *  minimum.
 * 
 *   The precision is the maximum number of characters to be written to the
 *  output.  The precision is applied before the width, thus the output will be
 *  truncated to precision characters even if the width is greater than
 *  the precision.  If the precision is not specified then there is no explicit
 *  limit on the number of characters.
 * 
 *  Character
 * 
 *  This conversion may be applied to char and Character.  It
 *  may also be applied to the types byte, Byte,
 *  short, and Short, int and Integer when
 *  Character.isValidCodePoint(int) returns true.  If it returns
 *  false then an IllegalFormatCodePointException will be
 *  thrown.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   'c'
 *       '\u0063'
 *       Formats the argument as a Unicode character as described in Unicode Character
 *      Representation.  This may be more than one 16-bit char in
 *      the case where the argument represents a supplementary character.
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given, then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'C'
 *       '\u0043'
 *       The upper-case variant of 'c'.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The '-' flag defined for General
 *  conversions applies.  If the '#' flag is given, then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   The width is defined as for General conversions.
 * 
 *   The precision is not applicable.  If the precision is specified then an
 *  IllegalFormatPrecisionException will be thrown.
 * 
 *  Numeric
 * 
 *   Numeric conversions are divided into the following categories:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Byte, Short, Integer, and Long
 * 
 *   BigInteger
 * 
 *   Float and Double
 * 
 *   BigDecimal
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Numeric types will be formatted according to the following algorithm:
 * 
 *   Number Localization Algorithm
 * 
 *   After digits are obtained for the integer part, fractional part, and
 *  exponent (as appropriate for the data type), the following transformation
 *  is applied:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Each digit character d in the string is replaced by a
 *  locale-specific digit computed relative to the current locale's
 *  zero digit
 *  z; that is d -  '0'
 *   + z.
 * 
 *   If a decimal separator is present, a locale-specific decimal separator is
 *  substituted.
 * 
 *   If the ',' ('\u002c')
 *  flag is given, then the locale-specific grouping separator is
 *  inserted by scanning the integer part of the string from least significant
 *  to most significant digits and inserting a separator at intervals defined by
 *  the locale's grouping
 *  size.
 * 
 *   If the '0' flag is given, then the locale-specific zero digits are inserted
 *  after the sign character, if any, and before the first non-zero digit, until
 *  the length of the string is equal to the requested field width.
 * 
 *   If the value is negative and the '(' flag is given, then a
 *  '(' ('\u0028') is prepended and a ')'
 *  ('\u0029') is appended.
 * 
 *   If the value is negative (or floating-point negative zero) and
 *  '(' flag is not given, then a '-' ('\u002d')
 *  is prepended.
 * 
 *   If the '+' flag is given and the value is positive or zero (or
 *  floating-point positive zero), then a '+' ('\u002b')
 *  will be prepended.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   If the value is NaN or positive infinity the literal strings "NaN" or
 *  "Infinity" respectively, will be output.  If the value is negative infinity,
 *  then the output will be "(Infinity)" if the '(' flag is given
 *  otherwise the output will be "-Infinity".  These values are not localized.
 * 
 *   Byte, Short, Integer, and Long 
 * 
 *   The following conversions may be applied to byte, Byte,
 *  short, Short, int and Integer,
 *  long, and Long.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   'd'
 *       '\u0064'
 *       Formats the argument as a decimal integer. The localization algorithm is applied.
 * 
 *       If the '0' flag is given and the value is negative, then
 *      the zero padding will occur after the sign.
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'o'
 *       '\u006f'
 *       Formats the argument as an integer in base eight.  No localization
 *      is applied.
 * 
 *       If x is negative then the result will be an unsigned value
 *      generated by adding 2n to the value where n is the
 *      number of bits in the type as returned by the static SIZE field
 *      in the Byte, Short,
 *      Integer, or Long
 *      classes as appropriate.
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given then the output will always begin
 *      with the radix indicator '0'.
 * 
 *       If the '0' flag is given then the output will be padded
 *      with leading zeros to the field width following any indication of sign.
 * 
 *       If '(', '+', '  ', or ',' flags
 *      are given then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be
 *      thrown.
 * 
 *   'x'
 *       '\u0078'
 *       Formats the argument as an integer in base sixteen. No
 *      localization is applied.
 * 
 *       If x is negative then the result will be an unsigned value
 *      generated by adding 2n to the value where n is the
 *      number of bits in the type as returned by the static SIZE field
 *      in the Byte, Short,
 *      Integer, or Long
 *      classes as appropriate.
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given then the output will always begin
 *      with the radix indicator "0x".
 * 
 *       If the '0' flag is given then the output will be padded to
 *      the field width with leading zeros after the radix indicator or sign (if
 *      present).
 * 
 *       If '(', '  ', '+', or
 *      ',' flags are given then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'X'
 *       '\u0058'
 *       The upper-case variant of 'x'.  The entire string
 *      representing the number will be converted to upper case including the 'x' (if any) and
 *      all hexadecimal digits 'a' - 'f'
 *      ('\u0061' -  '\u0066').
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   If the conversion is 'o', 'x', or 'X' and
 *  both the '#' and the '0' flags are given, then result will
 *  contain the radix indicator ('0' for octal and "0x" or
 *  "0X" for hexadecimal), some number of zeros (based on the width),
 *  and the value.
 * 
 *   If the '-' flag is not given, then the space padding will occur
 *  before the sign.
 * 
 *   The following flags apply to numeric integral
 *  conversions:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   '+'
 *       '\u002b'
 *       Requires the output to include a positive sign for all positive
 *      numbers.  If this flag is not given then only negative values will
 *      include a sign.
 * 
 *       If both the '+' and '  ' flags are given
 *      then an IllegalFormatFlagsException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   '  '
 *       '\u0020'
 *       Requires the output to include a single extra space
 *      ('\u0020') for non-negative values.
 * 
 *       If both the '+' and '  ' flags are given
 *      then an IllegalFormatFlagsException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   '0'
 *       '\u0030'
 *       Requires the output to be padded with leading zeros to the minimum field
 *      width following any sign or radix indicator except when converting NaN
 *      or infinity.  If the width is not provided, then a MissingFormatWidthException will be thrown.
 * 
 *       If both the '-' and '0' flags are given then an
 *      IllegalFormatFlagsException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   ','
 *       '\u002c'
 *       Requires the output to include the locale-specific group separators as
 *      described in the "group" section of the
 *      localization algorithm.
 * 
 *   '('
 *       '\u0028'
 *       Requires the output to prepend a '('
 *      ('\u0028') and append a ')'
 *      ('\u0029') to negative values.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   If no flags are given the default formatting is
 *  as follows:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The output is right-justified within the width
 * 
 *   Negative numbers begin with a '-' ('\u002d')
 * 
 *   Positive numbers and zero do not include a sign or extra leading
 *  space
 * 
 *   No grouping separators are included
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The width is the minimum number of characters to
 *  be written to the output.  This includes any signs, digits, grouping
 *  separators, radix indicator, and parentheses.  If the length of the
 *  converted value is less than the width then the output will be padded by
 *  spaces ('\u0020') until the total number of characters equals
 *  width.  The padding is on the left by default.  If '-' flag is
 *  given then the padding will be on the right.  If width is not specified then

 *   BigInteger 
 * 
 *   The following conversions may be applied to BigInteger.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   'd'
 *       '\u0064'
 *       Requires the output to be formatted as a decimal integer. The localization algorithm is applied.
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'o'
 *       '\u006f'
 *       Requires the output to be formatted as an integer in base eight.
 *      No localization is applied.
 * 
 *       If x is negative then the result will be a signed value
 *      beginning with '-' ('\u002d').  Signed output is
 *      allowed for this type because unlike the primitive types it is not
 *      possible to create an unsigned equivalent without assuming an explicit
 *      data-type size.
 * 
 *       If x is positive or zero and the '+' flag is given
 *      then the result will begin with '+' ('\u002b').
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given then the output will always begin
 *      with '0' prefix.
 * 
 *       If the '0' flag is given then the output will be padded
 *      with leading zeros to the field width following any indication of sign.
 * 
 *       If the ',' flag is given then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'x'
 *       '\u0078'
 *       Requires the output to be formatted as an integer in base
 *      sixteen.  No localization is applied.
 * 
 *       If x is negative then the result will be a signed value
 *      beginning with '-' ('\u002d').  Signed output is
 *      allowed for this type because unlike the primitive types it is not
 *      possible to create an unsigned equivalent without assuming an explicit

 * 
 *       If x is positive or zero and the '+' flag is given
 *      then the result will begin with '+' ('\u002b').
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given then the output will always begin
 *      with the radix indicator "0x".
 * 
 *       If the '0' flag is given then the output will be padded to
 *      the field width with leading zeros after the radix indicator or sign (if
 *      present).
 * 
 *       If the ',' flag is given then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'X'
 *       '\u0058'
 *       The upper-case variant of 'x'.  The entire string
 *      representing the number will be converted to upper case including the 'x' (if any) and
 *      all hexadecimal digits 'a' - 'f'
 *      ('\u0061' - '\u0066').
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   If the conversion is 'o', 'x', or 'X' and
 *  both the '#' and the '0' flags are given, then result will
 *  contain the base indicator ('0' for octal and "0x" or
 *  "0X" for hexadecimal), some number of zeros (based on the width),
 *  and the value.
 * 
 *   If the '0' flag is given and the value is negative, then the
 *  zero padding will occur after the sign.
 * 
 *   If the '-' flag is not given, then the space padding will occur
 *  before the sign.
 * 
 *   All flags defined for Byte, Short, Integer, and
 *  Long apply.  The default behavior when no flags are
 *  given is the same as for Byte, Short, Integer, and Long.
 * 
 *   The specification of width is the same as
 *  defined for Byte, Short, Integer, and Long.
 * 
 *   The precision is not applicable.  If precision is specified then an
 *  IllegalFormatPrecisionException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   Float and Double
 * 
 *   The following conversions may be applied to float, Float, double and Double.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   'e'
 *       '\u0065'
 *       Requires the output to be formatted using computerized scientific notation.  The localization algorithm is applied.
 * 
 *       The formatting of the magnitude m depends upon its value.
 * 
 *       If m is NaN or infinite, the literal strings "NaN" or
 *      "Infinity", respectively, will be output.  These values are not
 *      localized.
 * 
 *       If m is positive-zero or negative-zero, then the exponent
 *      will be "+00".
 * 
 *       Otherwise, the result is a string that represents the sign and
 *      magnitude (absolute value) of the argument.  The formatting of the sign
 *      is described in the localization
 *      algorithm. The formatting of the magnitude m depends upon its
 *      value.
 * 
 *       Let n be the unique integer such that 10n
 *      <= m < 10n+1; then let a be the
 *      mathematically exact quotient of m and 10n so
 *      that 1 <= a < 10. The magnitude is then represented as the
 *      integer part of a, as a single decimal digit, followed by the
 *      decimal separator followed by decimal digits representing the fractional
 *      part of a, followed by the exponent symbol 'e'
 *      ('\u0065'), followed by the sign of the exponent, followed
 *      by a representation of n as a decimal integer, as produced by the
 *      method Long.toString(long, int), and zero-padded to include at
 *      least two digits.
 * 
 *       The number of digits in the result for the fractional part of
 *      m or a is equal to the precision.  If the precision is not
 *      specified then the default value is 6. If the precision is less
 *      than the number of digits which would appear after the decimal point in
 *      the string returned by Float.toString(float) or Double.toString(double) respectively, then the value will be rounded
 *      using the round half up
 *      algorithm.  Otherwise, zeros may be appended to reach the precision.
 *      For a canonical representation of the value, use Float.toString(float) or Double.toString(double) as
 *      appropriate.
 * 
 *      If the ',' flag is given, then an FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'E'
 *       '\u0045'
 *       The upper-case variant of 'e'.  The exponent symbol
 *      will be 'E' ('\u0045').
 * 
 *   'g'
 *       '\u0067'
 *       Requires the output to be formatted in general scientific notation
 *      as described below. The localization
 *      algorithm is applied.
 * 
 *       After rounding for the precision, the formatting of the resulting
 *      magnitude m depends on its value.
 * 
 *       If m is greater than or equal to 10-4 but less
 *      than 10precision then it is represented in decimal format.
 * 
 *       If m is less than 10-4 or greater than or equal to
 *      10precision, then it is represented in computerized scientific notation.
 * 
 *       The total number of significant digits in m is equal to the
 *      precision.  If the precision is not specified, then the default value is
 *      6.  If the precision is 0, then it is taken to be
 *      1.
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given then an FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'G'
 *       '\u0047'
 *       The upper-case variant of 'g'.
 * 
 *   'f'
 *       '\u0066'
 *       Requires the output to be formatted using decimal
 *      format.  The localization algorithm is
 *      applied.
 * 
 *       The result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude
 *      (absolute value) of the argument.  The formatting of the sign is
 *      described in the localization
 *      algorithm. The formatting of the magnitude m depends upon its
 *      value.
 * 
 *       If m NaN or infinite, the literal strings "NaN" or
 *      "Infinity", respectively, will be output.  These values are not
 *      localized.
 * 
 *       The magnitude is formatted as the integer part of m, with no
 *      leading zeroes, followed by the decimal separator followed by one or
 *      more decimal digits representing the fractional part of m.
 * 
 *       The number of digits in the result for the fractional part of
 *      m or a is equal to the precision.  If the precision is not
 *      specified then the default value is 6. If the precision is less
 *      than the number of digits which would appear after the decimal point in
 *      the string returned by Float.toString(float) or Double.toString(double) respectively, then the value will be rounded
 *      using the round half up
 *      algorithm.  Otherwise, zeros may be appended to reach the precision.
 *      For a canonical representation of the value, use Float.toString(float) or Double.toString(double) as
 *      appropriate.
 * 
 *   'a'
 *       '\u0061'
 *       Requires the output to be formatted in hexadecimal exponential
 *      form.  No localization is applied.
 * 
 *       The result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude
 *      (absolute value) of the argument x.
 * 
 *       If x is negative or a negative-zero value then the result
 *      will begin with '-' ('\u002d').
 * 
 *       If x is positive or a positive-zero value and the
 *      '+' flag is given then the result will begin with '+'
 *      ('\u002b').
 * 
 *       The formatting of the magnitude m depends upon its value.
 * 
 *      
 * 
 *       If the value is NaN or infinite, the literal strings "NaN" or
 *      "Infinity", respectively, will be output.
 * 
 *       If m is zero then it is represented by the string
 *      "0x0.0p0".
 * 
 *       If m is a double value with a normalized
 *      representation then substrings are used to represent the significand and
 *      exponent fields.  The significand is represented by the characters
 *      "0x1." followed by the hexadecimal representation of the rest
 *      of the significand as a fraction.  The exponent is represented by
 *      'p' ('\u0070') followed by a decimal string of the
 *      unbiased exponent as if produced by invoking Integer.toString on the exponent value.  If the
 *      precision is specified, the value is rounded to the given number of
 *      hexadecimal digits.
 * 
 *       If m is a double value with a subnormal
 *      representation then, unless the precision is specified to be in the range
 *      1 through 12, inclusive, the significand is represented by the characters
 *      '0x0.' followed by the hexadecimal representation of the rest of
 *      the significand as a fraction, and the exponent represented by
 *      'p-1022'.  If the precision is in the interval
 *      [1, 12], the subnormal value is normalized such that it
 *      begins with the characters '0x1.', rounded to the number of
 *      hexadecimal digits of precision, and the exponent adjusted
 *      accordingly.  Note that there must be at least one nonzero digit in a
 *      subnormal significand.
 * 
 *      
 * 
 *       If the '(' or ',' flags are given, then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'A'
 *       '\u0041'
 *       The upper-case variant of 'a'.  The entire string
 *      representing the number will be converted to upper case including the
 *      'x' ('\u0078') and 'p'
 *      ('\u0070' and all hexadecimal digits 'a' -
 *      'f' ('\u0061' - '\u0066').
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   All flags defined for Byte, Short, Integer, and
 *  Long apply.
 * 
 *   If the '#' flag is given, then the decimal separator will
 *  always be present.
 * 
 *   If no flags are given the default formatting
 *  is as follows:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The output is right-justified within the width
 * 
 *   Negative numbers begin with a '-'
 * 
 *   Positive numbers and positive zero do not include a sign or extra
 *  leading space
 * 
 *   No grouping separators are included
 * 
 *   The decimal separator will only appear if a digit follows it
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The width is the minimum number of characters
 *  to be written to the output.  This includes any signs, digits, grouping
 *  separators, decimal separators, exponential symbol, radix indicator,
 *  parentheses, and strings representing infinity and NaN as applicable.  If
 *  the length of the converted value is less than the width then the output
 *  will be padded by spaces ('\u0020') until the total number of
 *  characters equals width.  The padding is on the left by default.  If the
 *  '-' flag is given then the padding will be on the right.  If width
 *  is not specified then there is no minimum.
 * 
 *   If the conversion is 'e',
 *  'E' or 'f', then the precision is the number of digits
 *  after the decimal separator.  If the precision is not specified, then it is
 *  assumed to be 6.
 * 
 *   If the conversion is 'g' or 'G', then the precision is
 *  the total number of significant digits in the resulting magnitude after
 *  rounding.  If the precision is not specified, then the default value is
 *  6.  If the precision is 0, then it is taken to be
 *  1.
 * 
 *   If the conversion is 'a' or 'A', then the precision
 *  is the number of hexadecimal digits after the radix point.  If the
 *  precision is not provided, then all of the digits as returned by Double.toHexString(double) will be output.
 * 
 *   BigDecimal 
 * 
 *   The following conversions may be applied BigDecimal.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   'e'
 *       '\u0065'
 *       Requires the output to be formatted using computerized scientific notation.  The localization algorithm is applied.
 * 
 *       The formatting of the magnitude m depends upon its value.
 * 
 *       If m is positive-zero or negative-zero, then the exponent
 *      will be "+00".
 * 
 *       Otherwise, the result is a string that represents the sign and
 *      magnitude (absolute value) of the argument.  The formatting of the sign
 *      is described in the localization
 *      algorithm. The formatting of the magnitude m depends upon its
 *      value.
 * 
 *       Let n be the unique integer such that 10n
 *      <= m < 10n+1; then let a be the
 *      mathematically exact quotient of m and 10n so
 *      that 1 <= a < 10. The magnitude is then represented as the
 *      integer part of a, as a single decimal digit, followed by the
 *      decimal separator followed by decimal digits representing the fractional
 *      part of a, followed by the exponent symbol 'e'
 *      ('\u0065'), followed by the sign of the exponent, followed
 *      by a representation of n as a decimal integer, as produced by the
 *      method Long.toString(long, int), and zero-padded to include at
 *      least two digits.
 * 
 *       The number of digits in the result for the fractional part of
 *      m or a is equal to the precision.  If the precision is not
 *      specified then the default value is 6.  If the precision is
 *      less than the number of digits to the right of the decimal point then
 *      the value will be rounded using the
 *      round half up
 *      algorithm.  Otherwise, zeros may be appended to reach the precision.
 *      For a canonical representation of the value, use BigDecimal.toString().
 * 
 *       If the ',' flag is given, then an FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'E'
 *       '\u0045'
 *       The upper-case variant of 'e'.  The exponent symbol
 *      will be 'E' ('\u0045').
 * 
 *   'g'
 *       '\u0067'
 *       Requires the output to be formatted in general scientific notation
 *      as described below. The localization
 *      algorithm is applied.
 * 
 *       After rounding for the precision, the formatting of the resulting
 *      magnitude m depends on its value.
 * 
 *       If m is greater than or equal to 10-4 but less
 *      than 10precision then it is represented in decimal format.
 * 
 *       If m is less than 10-4 or greater than or equal to
 *      10precision, then it is represented in computerized scientific notation.
 * 
 *       The total number of significant digits in m is equal to the
 *      precision.  If the precision is not specified, then the default value is
 *      6.  If the precision is 0, then it is taken to be
 *      1.
 * 
 *       If the '#' flag is given then an FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   'G'
 *       '\u0047'
 *       The upper-case variant of 'g'.
 * 
 *   'f'
 *       '\u0066'
 *       Requires the output to be formatted using decimal
 *      format.  The localization algorithm is
 *      applied.
 * 
 *       The result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude
 *      (absolute value) of the argument.  The formatting of the sign is
 *      described in the localization
 *      algorithm. The formatting of the magnitude m depends upon its
 *      value.
 * 
 *       The magnitude is formatted as the integer part of m, with no
 *      leading zeroes, followed by the decimal separator followed by one or
 *      more decimal digits representing the fractional part of m.
 * 
 *       The number of digits in the result for the fractional part of
 *      m or a is equal to the precision. If the precision is not
 *      specified then the default value is 6.  If the precision is
 *      less than the number of digits to the right of the decimal point
 *      then the value will be rounded using the
 *      round half up
 *      algorithm.  Otherwise, zeros may be appended to reach the precision.
 *      For a canonical representation of the value, use BigDecimal.toString().
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   All flags defined for Byte, Short, Integer, and
 *  Long apply.
 * 
 *   If the '#' flag is given, then the decimal separator will
 *  always be present.
 * 
 *   The default behavior when no flags are
 *  given is the same as for Float and Double.
 * 
 *   The specification of width and precision is the same as defined for Float and
 *  Double.
 * 
 *  Date/Time
 * 
 *   This conversion may be applied to long, Long, Calendar, Date and TemporalAccessor
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   't'
 *       '\u0074'
 *       Prefix for date and time conversion characters.
 *   'T'
 *       '\u0054'
 *       The upper-case variant of 't'.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The following date and time conversion character suffixes are defined
 *  for the 't' and 'T' conversions.  The types are similar to
 *  but not completely identical to those defined by GNU date and
 *  POSIX strftime(3c).  Additional conversion types are provided to
 *  access Java-specific functionality (e.g. 'L' for milliseconds
 *  within the second).
 * 
 *   The following conversion characters are used for formatting times:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   'H'
 *       '\u0048'
 *       Hour of the day for the 24-hour clock, formatted as two digits with
 *      a leading zero as necessary i.e. 00 - 23. 00
 *      corresponds to midnight.
 * 
 *  'I'
 *       '\u0049'
 *       Hour for the 12-hour clock, formatted as two digits with a leading
 *      zero as necessary, i.e.  01 - 12.  01 corresponds to
 *      one o'clock (either morning or afternoon).
 * 
 *  'k'
 *       '\u006b'
 *       Hour of the day for the 24-hour clock, i.e. 0 - 23.
 *      0 corresponds to midnight.
 * 
 *  'l'
 *       '\u006c'
 *       Hour for the 12-hour clock, i.e. 1 - 12.  1
 *      corresponds to one o'clock (either morning or afternoon).
 * 
 *  'M'
 *       '\u004d'
 *       Minute within the hour formatted as two digits with a leading zero
 *      as necessary, i.e.  00 - 59.
 * 
 *  'S'
 *       '\u0053'
 *       Seconds within the minute, formatted as two digits with a leading
 *      zero as necessary, i.e. 00 - 60 ("60" is a special
 *      value required to support leap seconds).
 * 
 *  'L'
 *       '\u004c'
 *       Millisecond within the second formatted as three digits with
 *      leading zeros as necessary, i.e. 000 - 999.
 * 
 *  'N'
 *       '\u004e'
 *       Nanosecond within the second, formatted as nine digits with leading
 *      zeros as necessary, i.e. 000000000 - 999999999.  The precision
 *      of this value is limited by the resolution of the underlying operating
 *      system or hardware.
 * 
 *  'p'
 *       '\u0070'
 *       Locale-specific morning or afternoon marker
 *      in lower case, e.g."am" or "pm".  Use of the
 *      conversion prefix 'T' forces this output to upper case.  (Note
 *      that 'p' produces lower-case output.  This is different from
 *      GNU date and POSIX strftime(3c) which produce
 *      upper-case output.)
 * 
 *  'z'
 *       '\u007a'
 *       RFC 822
 *      style numeric time zone offset from GMT, e.g. -0800.  This
 *      value will be adjusted as necessary for Daylight Saving Time.  For
 *      long, Long, and Date the time zone used is
 *      the default time zone for this
 *      instance of the Java virtual machine.
 * 
 *  'Z'
 *       '\u005a'
 *       A string representing the abbreviation for the time zone.  This
 *      value will be adjusted as necessary for Daylight Saving Time.  For
 *      long, Long, and Date the time zone used is
 *      the default time zone for this
 *      instance of the Java virtual machine.  The Formatter's locale will
 *      supersede the locale of the argument (if any).
 * 
 *  's'
 *       '\u0073'
 *       Seconds since the beginning of the epoch starting at 1 January 1970
 *      00:00:00 UTC, i.e. Long.MIN_VALUE/1000 to
 *      Long.MAX_VALUE/1000.
 * 
 *  'Q'
 *       '\u004f'
 *       Milliseconds since the beginning of the epoch starting at 1 January
 *      1970 00:00:00 UTC, i.e. Long.MIN_VALUE to
 *      Long.MAX_VALUE. The precision of this value is limited by
 *      the resolution of the underlying operating system or hardware.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The following conversion characters are used for formatting dates:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  'B'
 *       '\u0042'
 *       Locale-specific full month name, e.g. "January", "February".
 * 
 *  'b'
 *       '\u0062'
 *       Locale-specific abbreviated month name,
 *      e.g. "Jan", "Feb".
 *

 *       Same as 'b'.
 * 
 *  'A'
 *       '\u0041'
 *       Locale-specific full name of the day of the week,
 *      e.g. "Sunday", "Monday"
 * 
 *  'a'
 *       '\u0061'
 *       Locale-specific short name of the day of the week,
 *      e.g. "Sun", "Mon"
 * 
 *  'C'
 *       '\u0043'
 *       Four-digit year divided by 100, formatted as two digits
 *      with leading zero as necessary, i.e. 00 - 99
 * 
 *  'Y'
 *       '\u0059'  Year, formatted to at least
 *      four digits with leading zeros as necessary, e.g. 0092 equals
 *      92 CE for the Gregorian calendar.
 * 
 *  'y'
 *       '\u0079'
 *       Last two digits of the year, formatted with leading zeros as
 *      necessary, i.e. 00 - 99.
 * 
 *  'j'
 *       '\u006a'
 *       Day of year, formatted as three digits with leading zeros as
 *      necessary, e.g. 001 - 366 for the Gregorian calendar.
 *      001 corresponds to the first day of the year.
 * 
 *  'm'
 *       '\u006d'
 *       Month, formatted as two digits with leading zeros as necessary,
 *      i.e. 01 - 13, where "01" is the first month of the
 *      year and ("13" is a special value required to support lunar
 *      calendars).
 * 
 *  'd'
 *       '\u0064'
 *       Day of month, formatted as two digits with leading zeros as
 *      necessary, i.e. 01 - 31, where "01" is the first day
 *      of the month.
 * 
 *  'e'
 *       '\u0065'
 *       Day of month, formatted as two digits, i.e. 1 - 31 where
 *      "1" is the first day of the month.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The following conversion characters are used for formatting common
 *  date/time compositions.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  'R'
 *       '\u0052'
 *       Time formatted for the 24-hour clock as "%tH:%tM"

 *  'r'
 *       '\u0072'
 *       Time formatted for the 12-hour clock as "%tI:%tM:%tS

 *      complete date formatted as "%tY-%tm-%td".
 * 
 *  'c'
 *       '\u0063'
 *       Date and time formatted as "%ta %tb %td %tT %tZ %tY",
 *      e.g. "Sun Jul 20 16:17:00 EDT 1969".
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   The '-' flag defined for General
 *  conversions applies.  If the '#' flag is given, then a FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   The width is the minimum number of characters to
 *  be written to the output.  If the length of the converted value is less than
 *  the width then the output will be padded by spaces
 *  ('\u0020') until the total number of characters equals width.
 *  The padding is on the left by default.  If the '-' flag is given
 *  then the padding will be on the right.  If width is not specified then there
 *  is no minimum.
 * 
 *   The precision is not applicable.  If the precision is specified then an
 *  IllegalFormatPrecisionException will be thrown.
 * 
 *  Percent
 * 
 *   The conversion does not correspond to any argument.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  '%'
 *       The result is a literal '%' ('\u0025')
 * 
 *   The width is the minimum number of characters to
 *  be written to the output including the '%'.  If the length of the
 *  converted value is less than the width then the output will be
 *  padded by spaces ('\u0020') until the total number of
 *  characters equals width.  The padding is on the left.  If width is not
 *  specified then just the '%' is output.
 * 
 *   The '-' flag defined for General
 *  conversions applies.  If any other flags are provided, then a
 *  FormatFlagsConversionMismatchException will be thrown.
 * 
 *   The precision is not applicable.  If the precision is specified an
 *  IllegalFormatPrecisionException will be thrown.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  Line Separator
 * 
 *   The conversion does not correspond to any argument.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  'n'
 *       the platform-specific line separator as returned by System.getProperty("line.separator").
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Flags, width, and precision are not applicable.  If any are provided an
 *  IllegalFormatFlagsException, IllegalFormatWidthException,
 *  and IllegalFormatPrecisionException, respectively will be thrown.
 * 
 *  Argument Index
 * 
 *   Format specifiers can reference arguments in three ways:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Explicit indexing is used when the format specifier contains an
 *  argument index.  The argument index is a decimal integer indicating the
 *  position of the argument in the argument list.  The first argument is
 *  referenced by "1$", the second by "2$", etc.  An argument
 *  may be referenced more than once.
 * 
 *   For example:
 * 
 *  
 *    formatter.format("%4$s %3$s %2$s %1$s %4$s %3$s %2$s %1$s",
 *                     "a", "b", "c", "d")
 *    // -> "d c b a d c b a"
 *  
 * 
 *   Relative indexing is used when the format specifier contains a
 *  '<' ('\u003c') flag which causes the argument for
 *  the previous format specifier to be re-used.  If there is no previous
 *  argument, then a MissingFormatArgumentException is thrown.
 * 
 *  
 *     formatter.format("%s %s %<s %<s", "a", "b", "c", "d")
 *     // -> "a b b b"
 *     // "c" and "d" are ignored because they are not referenced
 *  
 * 
 *   Ordinary indexing is used when the format specifier contains
 *  neither an argument index nor a '<' flag.  Each format specifier
 *  which uses ordinary indexing is assigned a sequential implicit index into
 *  argument list which is independent of the indices used by explicit or
 *  relative indexing.
 * 
 *  
 *    formatter.format("%s %s %s %s", "a", "b", "c", "d")
 *    // -> "a b c d"
 *  
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   It is possible to have a format string which uses all forms of indexing,
 *  for example:
 * 
 *  
 *    formatter.format("%2$s %s %<s %s", "a", "b", "c", "d")
 *    // -> "b a a b"
 *    // "c" and "d" are ignored because they are not referenced
 *  
 * 
 *   The maximum number of arguments is limited by the maximum dimension of a
 *  Java array as defined by
 *  The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification.
 *  If the argument index is does not correspond to an
 *  available argument, then a MissingFormatArgumentException is thrown.
 * 
 *   If there are more arguments than format specifiers, the extra arguments
 *  are ignored.
 * 
 *   Unless otherwise specified, passing a null argument to any
 *  method or constructor in this class will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown.
