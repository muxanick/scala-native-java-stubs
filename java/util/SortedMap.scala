/** A Map that further provides a total ordering on its keys.
 *  The map is ordered according to the natural
 *  ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator typically
 *  provided at sorted map creation time.  This order is reflected when
 *  iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the
 *  entrySet, keySet and values methods).
 *  Several additional operations are provided to take advantage of the
 *  ordering.  (This interface is the map analogue of SortedSet.)
 * 
 *  All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the Comparable
 *  interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator).  Furthermore, all
 *  such keys must be mutually comparable: k1.compareTo(k2) (or
 *  comparator.compare(k1, k2)) must not throw a
 *  ClassCastException for any keys k1 and k2 in
 *  the sorted map.  Attempts to violate this restriction will cause the
 *  offending method or constructor invocation to throw a
 *  ClassCastException.
 * 
 *  Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an
 *  explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if
 *  the sorted map is to correctly implement the Map interface.  (See
 *  the Comparable interface or Comparator interface for a
 *  precise definition of consistent with equals.)  This is so because
 *  the Map interface is defined in terms of the equals
 *  operation, but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its
 *  compareTo (or compare) method, so two keys that are
 *  deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map,
 *  equal.  The behavior of a tree map is well-defined even if its
 *  ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general
 *  contract of the Map interface.
 * 
 *  All general-purpose sorted map implementation classes should provide four
 *  "standard" constructors. It is not possible to enforce this recommendation
 *  though as required constructors cannot be specified by interfaces. The
 *  expected "standard" constructors for all sorted map implementations are:
 *  
 *    A void (no arguments) constructor, which creates an empty sorted map
 *    sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys.
 *    A constructor with a single argument of type Comparator, which
 *    creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the specified comparator.
 *    A constructor with a single argument of type Map, which creates
 *    a new map with the same key-value mappings as its argument, sorted
 *    according to the keys' natural ordering.
 *    A constructor with a single argument of type SortedMap, which
 *    creates a new sorted map with the same key-value mappings and the same
 *    ordering as the input sorted map.
 *  
 * 
 *  Note: several methods return submaps with restricted key
 *  ranges. Such ranges are half-open, that is, they include their low
 *  endpoint but not their high endpoint (where applicable).  If you need a
 *  closed range (which includes both endpoints), and the key type
 *  allows for calculation of the successor of a given key, merely request
 *  the subrange from lowEndpoint to
 *  successor(highEndpoint).  For example, suppose that m
 *  is a map whose keys are strings.  The following idiom obtains a view
 *  containing all of the key-value mappings in m whose keys are
 *  between low and high, inclusive:
 *    SortedMap<String, V> sub = m.subMap(low, high+"\0");
 * 
 *  A similar technique can be used to generate an open range
 *  (which contains neither endpoint).  The following idiom obtains a
 *  view containing all of the key-value mappings in m whose keys
 *  are between low and high, exclusive:
 *    SortedMap<String, V> sub = m.subMap(low+"\0", high);
 * 
 *  This interface is a member of the
 *  
 *  Java Collections Framework.
