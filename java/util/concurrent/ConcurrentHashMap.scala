/** A hash table supporting full concurrency of retrievals and
 *  high expected concurrency for updates. This class obeys the
 *  same functional specification as Hashtable, and
 *  includes versions of methods corresponding to each method of
 *  Hashtable. However, even though all operations are
 *  thread-safe, retrieval operations do not entail locking,
 *  and there is not any support for locking the entire table
 *  in a way that prevents all access.  This class is fully
 *  interoperable with Hashtable in programs that rely on its
 *  thread safety but not on its synchronization details.
 * 
 *  Retrieval operations (including get) generally do not
 *  block, so may overlap with update operations (including put
 *  and remove). Retrievals reflect the results of the most
 *  recently completed update operations holding upon their
 *  onset. (More formally, an update operation for a given key bears a
 *  happens-before relation with any (non-null) retrieval for
 *  that key reporting the updated value.)  For aggregate operations
 *  such as putAll and clear, concurrent retrievals may
 *  reflect insertion or removal of only some entries.  Similarly,
 *  Iterators, Spliterators and Enumerations return elements reflecting the
 *  state of the hash table at some point at or since the creation of the
 *  iterator/enumeration.  They do not throw ConcurrentModificationException.
 *  However, iterators are designed to be used by only one thread at a time.
 *  Bear in mind that the results of aggregate status methods including
 *  size, isEmpty, and containsValue are typically
 *  useful only when a map is not undergoing concurrent updates in other threads.
 *  Otherwise the results of these methods reflect transient states
 *  that may be adequate for monitoring or estimation purposes, but not
 *  for program control.
 * 
 *  The table is dynamically expanded when there are too many
 *  collisions (i.e., keys that have distinct hash codes but fall into
 *  the same slot modulo the table size), with the expected average
 *  effect of maintaining roughly two bins per mapping (corresponding
 *  to a 0.75 load factor threshold for resizing). There may be much
 *  variance around this average as mappings are added and removed, but
 *  overall, this maintains a commonly accepted time/space tradeoff for
 *  hash tables.  However, resizing this or any other kind of hash
 *  table may be a relatively slow operation. When possible, it is a
 *  good idea to provide a size estimate as an optional initialCapacity constructor argument. An additional optional
 *  loadFactor constructor argument provides a further means of
 *  customizing initial table capacity by specifying the table density
 *  to be used in calculating the amount of space to allocate for the
 *  given number of elements.  Also, for compatibility with previous
 *  versions of this class, constructors may optionally specify an
 *  expected concurrencyLevel as an additional hint for
 *  internal sizing.  Note that using many keys with exactly the same
 *  hashCode() is a sure way to slow down performance of any
 *  hash table. To ameliorate impact, when keys are Comparable,
 *  this class may use comparison order among keys to help break ties.
 * 
 *  A Set projection of a ConcurrentHashMap may be created
 *  (using newKeySet() or newKeySet(int)), or viewed
 *  (using keySet(Object) when only keys are of interest, and the
 *  mapped values are (perhaps transiently) not used or all take the
 *  same mapping value.
 * 
 *  A ConcurrentHashMap can be used as scalable frequency map (a
 *  form of histogram or multiset) by using LongAdder values and initializing via
 *  computeIfAbsent. For example, to add a count
 *  to a ConcurrentHashMap<String,LongAdder> freqs, you can use
 *  freqs.computeIfAbsent(k -> new LongAdder()).increment();
 * 
 *  This class and its views and iterators implement all of the
 *  optional methods of the Map and Iterator
 *  interfaces.
 * 
 *  Like Hashtable but unlike HashMap, this class
 *  does not allow null to be used as a key or value.
 * 
 *  ConcurrentHashMaps support a set of sequential and parallel bulk
 *  operations that, unlike most Stream methods, are designed
 *  to be safely, and often sensibly, applied even with maps that are
 *  being concurrently updated by other threads; for example, when
 *  computing a snapshot summary of the values in a shared registry.
 *  There are three kinds of operation, each with four forms, accepting
 *  functions with Keys, Values, Entries, and (Key, Value) arguments
 *  and/or return values. Because the elements of a ConcurrentHashMap
 *  are not ordered in any particular way, and may be processed in
 *  different orders in different parallel executions, the correctness
 *  of supplied functions should not depend on any ordering, or on any
 *  other objects or values that may transiently change while
 *  computation is in progress; and except for forEach actions, should
 *  ideally be side-effect-free. Bulk operations on Map.Entry
 *  objects do not support method setValue.
 * 
 *  
 *   forEach: Perform a given action on each element.
 *  A variant form applies a given transformation on each element
 *  before performing the action.
 * 
 *   search: Return the first available non-null result of
 *  applying a given function on each element; skipping further
 *  search when a result is found.
 * 
 *   reduce: Accumulate each element.  The supplied reduction
 *  function cannot rely on ordering (more formally, it should be
 *  both associative and commutative).  There are five variants:
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *   Plain reductions. (There is not a form of this method for
 *  (key, value) function arguments since there is no corresponding
 *  return type.)
 * 
 *   Mapped reductions that accumulate the results of a given
 *  function applied to each element.
 * 
 *   Reductions to scalar doubles, longs, and ints, using a
 *  given basis value.
 * 
 *  
 *  
 *  
 * 
 *  These bulk operations accept a parallelismThreshold
 *  argument. Methods proceed sequentially if the current map size is
 *  estimated to be less than the given threshold. Using a value of
 *  Long.MAX_VALUE suppresses all parallelism.  Using a value
 *  of 1 results in maximal parallelism by partitioning into
 *  enough subtasks to fully utilize the ForkJoinPool.commonPool() that is used for all parallel
 *  computations. Normally, you would initially choose one of these
 *  extreme values, and then measure performance of using in-between
 *  values that trade off overhead versus throughput.
 * 
 *  The concurrency properties of bulk operations follow
 *  from those of ConcurrentHashMap: Any non-null result returned
 *  from get(key) and related access methods bears a
 *  happens-before relation with the associated insertion or
 *  update.  The result of any bulk operation reflects the
 *  composition of these per-element relations (but is not
 *  necessarily atomic with respect to the map as a whole unless it
 *  is somehow known to be quiescent).  Conversely, because keys
 *  and values in the map are never null, null serves as a reliable
 *  atomic indicator of the current lack of any result.  To
 *  maintain this property, null serves as an implicit basis for
 *  all non-scalar reduction operations. For the double, long, and
 *  int versions, the basis should be one that, when combined with
 *  any other value, returns that other value (more formally, it
 *  should be the identity element for the reduction). Most common
 *  reductions have these properties; for example, computing a sum
 *  with basis 0 or a minimum with basis MAX_VALUE.
 * 
 *  Search and transformation functions provided as arguments
 *  should similarly return null to indicate the lack of any result
 *  (in which case it is not used). In the case of mapped
 *  reductions, this also enables transformations to serve as
 *  filters, returning null (or, in the case of primitive
 *  specializations, the identity basis) if the element should not
 *  be combined. You can create compound transformations and
 *  filterings by composing them yourself under this "null means
 *  there is nothing there now" rule before using them in search or
 *  reduce operations.
 * 
 *  Methods accepting and/or returning Entry arguments maintain
 *  key-value associations. They may be useful for example when
 *  finding the key for the greatest value. Note that "plain" Entry
 *  arguments can be supplied using new
 *  AbstractMap.SimpleEntry(k,v).
 * 
 *  Bulk operations may complete abruptly, throwing an
 *  exception encountered in the application of a supplied
 *  function. Bear in mind when handling such exceptions that other
 *  concurrently executing functions could also have thrown
 *  exceptions, or would have done so if the first exception had
 *  not occurred.
 * 
 *  Speedups for parallel compared to sequential forms are common
 *  but not guaranteed.  Parallel operations involving brief functions
 *  on small maps may execute more slowly than sequential forms if the
 *  underlying work to parallelize the computation is more expensive
 *  than the computation itself.  Similarly, parallelization may not
 *  lead to much actual parallelism if all processors are busy
 *  performing unrelated tasks.
 * 
 *  All arguments to all task methods must be non-null.
 * 
 *  This class is a member of the
 *  
 *  Java Collections Framework.
