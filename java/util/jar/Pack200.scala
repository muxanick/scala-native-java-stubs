/** Transforms a JAR file to or from a packed stream in Pack200 format.
 *  Please refer to Network Transfer Format JSR 200 Specification at
 *  http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr200/index.html
 *  
 *  Typically the packer engine is used by application developers
 *  to deploy or host JAR files on a website.
 *  The unpacker  engine is used by deployment applications to
 *  transform the byte-stream back to JAR format.
 *  
 *  Here is an example using  packer and unpacker:
 *  
 *     import java.util.jar.Pack200;
 *     import java.util.jar.Pack200.*;
 *     ...
 *     // Create the Packer object
 *     Packer packer = Pack200.newPacker();
 * 
 *     // Initialize the state by setting the desired properties
 *     Map p = packer.properties();
 *     // take more time choosing codings for better compression
 *     p.put(Packer.EFFORT, "7");  // default is "5"
 *     // use largest-possible archive segments (>10% better compression).
 *     p.put(Packer.SEGMENT_LIMIT, "-1");
 *     // reorder files for better compression.
 *     p.put(Packer.KEEP_FILE_ORDER, Packer.FALSE);
 *     // smear modification times to a single value.
 *     p.put(Packer.MODIFICATION_TIME, Packer.LATEST);
 *     // ignore all JAR deflation requests,
 *     // transmitting a single request to use "store" mode.
 *     p.put(Packer.DEFLATE_HINT, Packer.FALSE);
 *     // discard debug attributes
 *     p.put(Packer.CODE_ATTRIBUTE_PFX+"LineNumberTable", Packer.STRIP);
 *     // throw an error if an attribute is unrecognized
 *     p.put(Packer.UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE, Packer.ERROR);
 *     // pass one class file uncompressed:
 *     p.put(Packer.PASS_FILE_PFX+0, "mutants/Rogue.class");
 *     try {
 *         JarFile jarFile = new JarFile("/tmp/testref.jar");
 *         FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("/tmp/test.pack");
 *         // Call the packer
 *         packer.pack(jarFile, fos);
 *         jarFile.close();
 *         fos.close();
 * 
 *         File f = new File("/tmp/test.pack");
 *         FileOutputStream fostream = new FileOutputStream("/tmp/test.jar");
 *         JarOutputStream jostream = new JarOutputStream(fostream);
 *         Unpacker unpacker = Pack200.newUnpacker();
 *         // Call the unpacker
 *         unpacker.unpack(f, jostream);
 *         // Must explicitly close the output.
 *         jostream.close();
 *     } catch (IOException ioe) {
 *         ioe.printStackTrace();
 *     }
 *  
 *  
 *  A Pack200 file compressed with gzip can be hosted on HTTP/1.1 web servers.
 *  The deployment applications can use "Accept-Encoding=pack200-gzip". This
 *  indicates to the server that the client application desires a version of
 *  the file encoded with Pack200 and further compressed with gzip. Please
 *  refer to  Java Deployment Guide for more details and
 *  techniques.
 *  
 *  Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or
 *  method in this class will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown.

abstract class Pack200 extends Object {

object Pack200 {
    /** The packer engine applies various transformations to the input JAR file,
     *  making the pack stream highly compressible by a compressor such as
     *  gzip or zip. An instance of the engine can be obtained
     *  using Pack200.newPacker().
     * 
     *  The high degree of compression is achieved
     *  by using a number of techniques described in the JSR 200 specification.
     *  Some of the techniques are sorting, re-ordering and co-location of the
     *  constant pool.
     *  
     *  The pack engine is initialized to an initial state as described
     *  by their properties below.
     *  The initial state can be manipulated by getting the
     *  engine properties (using properties()) and storing
     *  the modified properties on the map.
     *  The resource files will be passed through with no changes at all.
     *  The class files will not contain identical bytes, since the unpacker
     *  is free to change minor class file features such as constant pool order.
     *  However, the class files will be semantically identical,
     *  as specified in
     *  The Javaâ„¢ Virtual Machine Specification.
     *  
     *  By default, the packer does not change the order of JAR elements.
     *  Also, the modification time and deflation hint of each
     *  JAR element is passed unchanged.
     *  (Any other ZIP-archive information, such as extra attributes
     *  giving Unix file permissions, are lost.)
     *  
     *  Note that packing and unpacking a JAR will in general alter the
     *  bytewise contents of classfiles in the JAR.  This means that packing
     *  and unpacking will in general invalidate any digital signatures
     *  which rely on bytewise images of JAR elements.  In order both to sign
     *  and to pack a JAR, you must first pack and unpack the JAR to
     *  "normalize" it, then compute signatures on the unpacked JAR elements,
     *  and finally repack the signed JAR.
     *  Both packing steps should
     *  use precisely the same options, and the segment limit may also
     *  need to be set to "-1", to prevent accidental variation of segment
     *  boundaries as class file sizes change slightly.
     *  
     *  (Here's why this works:  Any reordering the packer does
     *  of any classfile structures is idempotent, so the second packing
     *  does not change the orderings produced by the first packing.
     *  Also, the unpacker is guaranteed by the JSR 200 specification
     *  to produce a specific bytewise image for any given transmission
     *  ordering of archive elements.)
     *  
     *  In order to maintain backward compatibility, the pack file's version is
     *  set to accommodate the class files present in the input JAR file. In
     *  other words, the pack file version will be the latest, if the class files
     *  are the latest and conversely the pack file version will be the oldest
     *  if the class file versions are also the oldest. For intermediate class
     *  file versions the corresponding pack file version will be used.
     *  For example:
     *     If the input JAR-files are solely comprised of 1.5  (or  lesser)
     *  class files, a 1.5 compatible pack file is  produced. This will also be
     *  the case for archives that have no class files.
     *     If the input JAR-files contains a 1.6 class file, then the pack file
     *  version will be set to 1.6.
     *  
     *  Note: Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a
     *  constructor or method in this class will cause a NullPointerException
     *  to be thrown.
