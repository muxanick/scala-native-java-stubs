/** The Printable interface is implemented
 *  by the print methods of the current
 *  page painter, which is called by the printing
 *  system to render a page.  When building a
 *  Pageable, pairs of PageFormat
 *  instances and instances that implement
 *  this interface are used to describe each page. The
 *  instance implementing Printable is called to
 *  print the page's graphics.
 *  
 *  A Printable(..) may be set on a PrinterJob.
 *  When the client subsequently initiates printing by calling
 *  PrinterJob.print(..) control
 *  
 *  is handed to the printing system until all pages have been printed.
 *  It does this by calling Printable.print(..) until
 *  all pages in the document have been printed.
 *  In using the Printable interface the printing
 *  commits to image the contents of a page whenever
 *  requested by the printing system.
 *  
 *  The parameters to Printable.print(..) include a
 *  PageFormat which describes the printable area of
 *  the page, needed for calculating the contents that will fit the
 *  page, and the page index, which specifies the zero-based print
 *  stream index of the requested page.
 *  
 *  For correct printing behaviour, the following points should be
 *  observed:
 *  
 *   The printing system may request a page index more than once.
 *  On each occasion equal PageFormat parameters will be supplied.
 * 
 *  The printing system will call Printable.print(..)
 *  with page indexes which increase monotonically, although as noted above,
 *  the Printable should expect multiple calls for a page index
 *  and that page indexes may be skipped, when page ranges are specified
 *  by the client, or by a user through a print dialog.
 * 
 *  If multiple collated copies of a document are requested, and the
 *  printer cannot natively support this, then the document may be imaged
 *  multiple times. Printing will start each copy from the lowest print
 *  stream page index page.
 * 
 *  With the exception of re-imaging an entire document for multiple
 *  collated copies, the increasing page index order means that when
 *  page N is requested if a client needs to calculate page break position,
 *  it may safely discard any state related to pages < N, and make current
 *  that for page N. "State" usually is just the calculated position in the
 *  document that corresponds to the start of the page.
 * 
 *  When called by the printing system the Printable must
 *  inspect and honour the supplied PageFormat parameter as well as the
 *  page index.  The format of the page to be drawn is specified by the
 *  supplied PageFormat. The size, orientation and imageable area of the page
 *  is therefore already determined and rendering must be within this
 *  imageable area.
 *  This is key to correct printing behaviour, and it has the
 *  implication that the client has the responsibility of tracking
 *  what content belongs on the specified page.
 * 
 *  When the Printable is obtained from a client-supplied
 *  Pageable then the client may provide different PageFormats
 *  for each page index. Calculations of page breaks must account for this.
 *
