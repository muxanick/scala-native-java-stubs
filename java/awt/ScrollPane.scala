/** A container class which implements automatic horizontal and/or
 *  vertical scrolling for a single child component.  The display
 *  policy for the scrollbars can be set to:
 *  
 *  as needed: scrollbars created and shown only when needed by scrollpane
 *  always: scrollbars created and always shown by the scrollpane
 *  never: scrollbars never created or shown by the scrollpane
 *  
 *  
 *  The state of the horizontal and vertical scrollbars is represented
 *  by two ScrollPaneAdjustable objects (one for each
 *  dimension) which implement the Adjustable interface.
 *  The API provides methods to access those objects such that the
 *  attributes on the Adjustable object (such as unitIncrement, value,
 *  etc.) can be manipulated.
 *  
 *  Certain adjustable properties (minimum, maximum, blockIncrement,
 *  and visibleAmount) are set internally by the scrollpane in accordance
 *  with the geometry of the scrollpane and its child and these should
 *  not be set by programs using the scrollpane.
 *  
 *  If the scrollbar display policy is defined as "never", then the
 *  scrollpane can still be programmatically scrolled using the
 *  setScrollPosition() method and the scrollpane will move and clip
 *  the child's contents appropriately.  This policy is useful if the
 *  program needs to create and manage its own adjustable controls.
 *  
 *  The placement of the scrollbars is controlled by platform-specific
 *  properties set by the user outside of the program.
 *  
 *  The initial size of this container is set to 100x100, but can
 *  be reset using setSize().
 *  
 *  Scrolling with the wheel on a wheel-equipped mouse is enabled by default.
 *  This can be disabled using setWheelScrollingEnabled.
 *  Wheel scrolling can be customized by setting the block and
 *  unit increment of the horizontal and vertical Adjustables.
 *  For information on how mouse wheel events are dispatched, see
 *  the class description for MouseWheelEvent.
 *  
 *  Insets are used to define any space used by scrollbars and any
 *  borders created by the scroll pane. getInsets() can be used
 *  to get the current value for the insets.  If the value of
 *  scrollbarsAlwaysVisible is false, then the value of the insets
 *  will change dynamically depending on whether the scrollbars are
 *  currently visible or not.
