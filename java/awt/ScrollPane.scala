// A container class which implements automatic horizontal and/or
// vertical scrolling for a single child component.  The display
// policy for the scrollbars can be set to:
// 
// as needed: scrollbars created and shown only when needed by scrollpane
// always: scrollbars created and always shown by the scrollpane
// never: scrollbars never created or shown by the scrollpane
// 
// 
// The state of the horizontal and vertical scrollbars is represented
// by two ScrollPaneAdjustable objects (one for each
// dimension) which implement the Adjustable interface.
// The API provides methods to access those objects such that the
// attributes on the Adjustable object (such as unitIncrement, value,
// etc.) can be manipulated.
// 
// Certain adjustable properties (minimum, maximum, blockIncrement,
// and visibleAmount) are set internally by the scrollpane in accordance
// with the geometry of the scrollpane and its child and these should
// not be set by programs using the scrollpane.
// 
// If the scrollbar display policy is defined as "never", then the
// scrollpane can still be programmatically scrolled using the
// setScrollPosition() method and the scrollpane will move and clip
// the child's contents appropriately.  This policy is useful if the
// program needs to create and manage its own adjustable controls.
// 
// The placement of the scrollbars is controlled by platform-specific
// properties set by the user outside of the program.
// 
// The initial size of this container is set to 100x100, but can
// be reset using setSize().
// 
// Scrolling with the wheel on a wheel-equipped mouse is enabled by default.
// This can be disabled using setWheelScrollingEnabled.
// Wheel scrolling can be customized by setting the block and
// unit increment of the horizontal and vertical Adjustables.
// For information on how mouse wheel events are dispatched, see
// the class description for MouseWheelEvent.
// 
// Insets are used to define any space used by scrollbars and any
// borders created by the scroll pane. getInsets() can be used
// to get the current value for the insets.  If the value of
// scrollbarsAlwaysVisible is false, then the value of the insets
// will change dynamically depending on whether the scrollbars are
// currently visible or not.
