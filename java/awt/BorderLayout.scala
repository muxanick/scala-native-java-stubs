/** A border layout lays out a container, arranging and resizing
 *  its components to fit in five regions:
 *  north, south, east, west, and center.
 *  Each region may contain no more than one component, and
 *  is identified by a corresponding constant:
 *  NORTH, SOUTH, EAST,
 *  WEST, and CENTER.  When adding a
 *  component to a container with a border layout, use one of these
 *  five constants, for example:
 *  
 *     Panel p = new Panel();
 *     p.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
 *     p.add(new Button("Okay"), BorderLayout.SOUTH);
 *  
 *  As a convenience, BorderLayout interprets the
 *  absence of a string specification the same as the constant
 *  CENTER:
 *  
 *     Panel p2 = new Panel();
 *     p2.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
 *     p2.add(new TextArea());  // Same as p.add(new TextArea(), BorderLayout.CENTER);
 *  
 *  
 *  In addition, BorderLayout supports the relative
 *  positioning constants, PAGE_START, PAGE_END,
 *  LINE_START, and LINE_END.
 *  In a container whose ComponentOrientation is set to
 *  ComponentOrientation.LEFT_TO_RIGHT, these constants map to
 *  NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, and
 *  EAST, respectively.
 *  
 *  For compatibility with previous releases, BorderLayout
 *  also includes the relative positioning constants BEFORE_FIRST_LINE,
 *  AFTER_LAST_LINE, BEFORE_LINE_BEGINS and
 *  AFTER_LINE_ENDS.  These are equivalent to
 *  PAGE_START, PAGE_END, LINE_START
 *  and LINE_END respectively.  For
 *  consistency with the relative positioning constants used by other
 *  components, the latter constants are preferred.
 *  
 *  Mixing both absolute and relative positioning constants can lead to
 *  unpredictable results.  If
 *  you use both types, the relative constants will take precedence.
 *  For example, if you add components using both the NORTH
 *  and PAGE_START constants in a container whose
 *  orientation is LEFT_TO_RIGHT, only the
 *  PAGE_START will be layed out.
 *  
 *  NOTE: Currently (in the Java 2 platform v1.2),
 *  BorderLayout does not support vertical
 *  orientations.  The isVertical setting on the container's
 *  ComponentOrientation is not respected.
 *  
 *  The components are laid out according to their
 *  preferred sizes and the constraints of the container's size.
 *  The NORTH and SOUTH components may
 *  be stretched horizontally; the EAST and
 *  WEST components may be stretched vertically;
 *  the CENTER component may stretch both horizontally
 *  and vertically to fill any space left over.
 *  
 *  Here is an example of five buttons in an applet laid out using
 *  the BorderLayout layout manager:
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  The code for this applet is as follows:
 * 
 *  
 *  import java.awt.*;
 *  import java.applet.Applet;
 * 
 *  public class buttonDir extends Applet {
 *    public void init() {
 *      setLayout(new BorderLayout());
 *      add(new Button("North"), BorderLayout.NORTH);
 *      add(new Button("South"), BorderLayout.SOUTH);
 *      add(new Button("East"), BorderLayout.EAST);
 *      add(new Button("West"), BorderLayout.WEST);
 *      add(new Button("Center"), BorderLayout.CENTER);
 *    }
 *  }
 *  
 *
