/** The GeneralPath class represents a geometric path

 *  (BÃ©zier) curves.  It can contain multiple subpaths.
 *  
 *  GeneralPath is a legacy final class which exactly
 *  implements the behavior of its superclass Path2D.Float.
 *  Together with Path2D.Double, the Path2D classes
 *  provide full implementations of a general geometric path that
 *  support all of the functionality of the Shape and
 *  PathIterator interfaces with the ability to explicitly
 *  select different levels of internal coordinate precision.
 *  
 *  Use Path2D.Float (or this legacy GeneralPath
 *  subclass) when dealing with data that can be represented
 *  and used with floating point precision.  Use Path2D.Double
 *  for data that requires the accuracy or range of double precision.
