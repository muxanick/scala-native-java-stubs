/** A CardLayout object is a layout manager for a
 *  container. It treats each component in the container as a card.
 *  Only one card is visible at a time, and the container acts as
 *  a stack of cards. The first component added to a
 *  CardLayout object is the visible component when the
 *  container is first displayed.
 *  
 *  The ordering of cards is determined by the container's own internal
 *  ordering of its component objects. CardLayout
 *  defines a set of methods that allow an application to flip
 *  through these cards sequentially, or to show a specified card.
 *  The addLayoutComponent(java.awt.Component, java.lang.Object)
 *  method can be used to associate a string identifier with a given card
 *  for fast random access.
