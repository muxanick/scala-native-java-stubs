/** The GraphicsConfiguration class describes the
 *  characteristics of a graphics destination such as a printer or monitor.
 *  There can be many GraphicsConfiguration objects associated
 *  with a single graphics device, representing different drawing modes or
 *  capabilities.  The corresponding native structure will vary from platform
 *  to platform.  For example, on X11 windowing systems,
 *  each visual is a different GraphicsConfiguration.
 *  On Microsoft Windows, GraphicsConfigurations represent
 *  PixelFormats available in the current resolution and color depth.
 *  
 *  In a virtual device multi-screen environment in which the desktop
 *  area could span multiple physical screen devices, the bounds of the
 *  GraphicsConfiguration objects are relative to the
 *  virtual coordinate system.  When setting the location of a
 *  component, use getBounds to get the bounds of
 *  the desired GraphicsConfiguration and offset the location
 *  with the coordinates of the GraphicsConfiguration,
 *  as the following code sample illustrates:
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *       Frame f = new Frame(gc);  // where gc is a GraphicsConfiguration
 *       Rectangle bounds = gc.getBounds();
 *       f.setLocation(10 + bounds.x, 10 + bounds.y); 
 * 
 *  
 *  To determine if your environment is a virtual device
 *  environment, call getBounds on all of the
 *  GraphicsConfiguration objects in your system.  If
 *  any of the origins of the returned bounds is not (0,Â 0),
 *  your environment is a virtual device environment.
 * 
 *  
 *  You can also use getBounds to determine the bounds
 *  of the virtual device.  To do this, first call getBounds on all
 *  of the GraphicsConfiguration objects in your
 *  system.  Then calculate the union of all of the bounds returned
 *  from the calls to getBounds.  The union is the
 *  bounds of the virtual device.  The following code sample
 *  calculates the bounds of the virtual device.
 * 
 *  
 *       Rectangle virtualBounds = new Rectangle();
 *       GraphicsEnvironment ge = GraphicsEnvironment.
 *               getLocalGraphicsEnvironment();
 *       GraphicsDevice[] gs =
 *               ge.getScreenDevices();
 *       for (int j = 0; j < gs.length; j++) {
 *           GraphicsDevice gd = gs[j];
 *           GraphicsConfiguration[] gc =
 *               gd.getConfigurations();
 *           for (int i=0; i < gc.length; i++) {
 *               virtualBounds =
 *                   virtualBounds.union(gc[i].getBounds());
 *           }
 *       }
