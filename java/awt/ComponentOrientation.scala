/** The ComponentOrientation class encapsulates the language-sensitive
 *  orientation that is to be used to order the elements of a component
 *  or of text. It is used to reflect the differences in this ordering
 *  between Western alphabets, Middle Eastern (such as Hebrew), and Far
 *  Eastern (such as Japanese).
 *  
 *  Fundamentally, this governs items (such as characters) which are laid out
 *  in lines, with the lines then laid out in a block. This also applies
 *  to items in a widget: for example, in a check box where the box is
 *  positioned relative to the text.
 *  
 *  There are four different orientations used in modern languages
 *  as in the following table.
 *  
 *  LT          RT          TL          TR
 *  A B C       C B A       A D G       G D A
 *  D E F       F E D       B E H       H E B
 *  G H I       I H G       C F I       I F C
 *  
 *  (In the header, the two-letter abbreviation represents the item direction
 *  in the first letter, and the line direction in the second. For example,
 *  LT means "items left-to-right, lines top-to-bottom",
 *  TL means "items top-to-bottom, lines left-to-right", and so on.)
 *  
 *  The orientations are:
 *  
 *  LT - Western Europe (optional for Japanese, Chinese, Korean)
 *  RT - Middle East (Arabic, Hebrew)
 *  TR - Japanese, Chinese, Korean
 *  TL - Mongolian
 *  
 *  Components whose view and controller code depends on orientation
 *  should use the isLeftToRight() and
 *  isHorizontal() methods to
 *  determine their behavior. They should not include switch-like
 *  code that keys off of the constants, such as:
 *  
 *  if (orientation == LEFT_TO_RIGHT) {
 *    ...
 *  } else if (orientation == RIGHT_TO_LEFT) {
 *    ...
 *  } else {
 *    // Oops
 *  }
 *  
 *  This is unsafe, since more constants may be added in the future and
 *  since it is not guaranteed that orientation objects will be unique.
