/** A FocusTraversalPolicy that determines traversal order based on the order
 *  of child Components in a Container. From a particular focus cycle root, the
 *  policy makes a pre-order traversal of the Component hierarchy, and traverses
 *  a Container's children according to the ordering of the array returned by
 *  Container.getComponents(). Portions of the hierarchy that are
 *  not visible and displayable will not be searched.
 *  
 *  If client code has explicitly set the focusability of a Component by either
 *  overriding Component.isFocusTraversable() or
 *  Component.isFocusable(), or by calling
 *  Component.setFocusable(), then a DefaultFocusTraversalPolicy
 *  behaves exactly like a ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy. If, however, the
 *  Component is relying on default focusability, then a
 *  DefaultFocusTraversalPolicy will reject all Components with non-focusable
 *  peers. This is the default FocusTraversalPolicy for all AWT Containers.
 *  
 *  The focusability of a peer is implementation-dependent. Sun recommends that
 *  all implementations for a particular native platform construct peers with
 *  the same focusability. The recommendations for Windows and Unix are that
 *  Canvases, Labels, Panels, Scrollbars, ScrollPanes, Windows, and lightweight
 *  Components have non-focusable peers, and all other Components have focusable
 *  peers. These recommendations are used in the Sun AWT implementations. Note
 *  that the focusability of a Component's peer is different from, and does not
 *  impact, the focusability of the Component itself.
 *  
 *  Please see
 *  
 *  How to Use the Focus Subsystem,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial, and the
 *  Focus Specification
 *  for more information.
