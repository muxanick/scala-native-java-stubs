// LSSerializerFilters provide applications the ability to
// examine nodes as they are being serialized and decide what nodes should
// be serialized or not. The LSSerializerFilter interface is
// based on the NodeFilter interface defined in [DOM Level 2 Traversal and      Range]
// .
//  Document, DocumentType,
// DocumentFragment, Notation, Entity
// , and children of Attr nodes are not passed to the filter.
// The child nodes of an EntityReference node are only passed
// to the filter if the EntityReference node is skipped by the
// method LSParserFilter.acceptNode().
//  When serializing an Element, the element is passed to the
// filter before any of its attributes are passed to the filter. Namespace
// declaration attributes, and default attributes (except in the case when "
// discard-default-content" is set to false), are never passed
// to the filter.
//  The result of any attempt to modify a node passed to a
// LSSerializerFilter is implementation dependent.
//  DOM applications must not raise exceptions in a filter. The effect of
// throwing exceptions from a filter is DOM implementation dependent.
//  For efficiency, a node passed to the filter may not be the same as the
// one that is actually in the tree. And the actual node (node object
// identity) may be reused during the process of filtering and serializing a
// document.
// See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load
//and Save Specification.
