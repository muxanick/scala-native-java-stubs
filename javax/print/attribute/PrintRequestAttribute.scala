package javax.print.attribute

// Interface PrintRequestAttribute is a tagging interface which a printing
// attribute class implements to indicate the attribute denotes a
// requested setting for a print job.
// 
// Attributes which are tagged with PrintRequestAttribute and are also tagged
// as PrintJobAttribute, represent the subset of job attributes which
// can be part of the specification of a job request.
// 
// If an attribute implements DocAttribute
// as well as PrintRequestAttribute, the client may include the
// attribute in a Doc}'s attribute set to specify
// a job setting which pertains just to that doc.
