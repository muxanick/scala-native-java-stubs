/** Class SheetCollate is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that
 *  specifies whether or not the media sheets of each copy of each printed
 *  document in a job are to be in sequence, when multiple copies of the document
 *  are specified by the Copies attribute. When SheetCollate is
 *  COLLATED, each copy of each document is printed with the print-stream sheets
 *  in sequence. When SheetCollate is UNCOLLATED, each print-stream sheet is
 *  printed a number of times equal to the value of the Copies
 *  attribute in succession. For example, suppose a document produces two media
 *  sheets as output, Copies is 6, and SheetCollate is UNCOLLATED;
 *  in this case six copies of the first media sheet are printed followed by
 *  six copies of the second media sheet.
 *  
 *  Whether the effect of sheet collation is achieved by placing copies of a
 *  document in multiple output bins or in the same output bin with
 *  implementation defined document separation is implementation dependent.
 *  Also whether it is achieved by making multiple passes over the job or by
 *  using an output sorter is implementation dependent.
 *  
 *  If a printer does not support the SheetCollate attribute (meaning the client
 *  cannot specify any particular sheet collation), the printer must behave as
 *  though SheetCollate were always set to COLLATED.
 *  
 *  The SheetCollate attribute interacts with the MultipleDocumentHandling attribute. The MultipleDocumentHandling attribute describes the collation of entire
 *  documents, and the SheetCollate attribute describes the semantics of
 *  collating individual pages within a document.
 *  
 *  The effect of a SheetCollate attribute on a multidoc print job (a job with
 *  multiple documents) depends on whether all the docs have the same sheet
 *  collation specified or whether different docs have different sheet
 *  collations specified, and on the (perhaps defaulted) value of the MultipleDocumentHandling attribute.
 *  
 *  
 *  If all the docs have the same sheet collation specified, then the following
 *  combinations of SheetCollate and MultipleDocumentHandling are permitted, and the printer reports an error
 *  when the job is submitted if any other combination is specified:
 *  
 *  
 *  SheetCollate = COLLATED, MultipleDocumentHandling = SINGLE_DOCUMENT -- All the input docs will be
 *  combined into one output document. Multiple copies of the output document
 *  will be produced with pages in collated order, i.e. pages 1, 2, 3, . . .,
 *  1, 2, 3, . . .
 *  
 *  
 *  SheetCollate = COLLATED, MultipleDocumentHandling = SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET -- All the input docs
 *  will be combined into one output document, and the first impression of each
 *  input doc will always start on a new media sheet. Multiple copies of the
 *  output document will be produced with pages in collated order, i.e. pages
 *  1, 2, 3, . . ., 1, 2, 3, . . .
 *  
 *  
 *  SheetCollate = COLLATED, MultipleDocumentHandling = SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES -- Each
 *  input doc will remain a separate output document. Multiple copies of each
 *  output document (call them A, B, . . .) will be produced with each document's
 *  pages in collated order, but the documents themselves in uncollated order,
 *  i.e. pages A1, A2, A3, . . ., A1, A2, A3, . . ., B1, B2, B3, . . ., B1, B2,
 *  B3, . . .
 *  
 *  
 *  SheetCollate = COLLATED, MultipleDocumentHandling = SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES -- Each input
 *  doc will remain a separate output document. Multiple copies of each output
 *  document (call them A, B, . . .) will be produced with each document's pages
 *  in collated order, with the documents themselves also in collated order, i.e.
 *  pages A1, A2, A3, . . ., B1, B2, B3, . . ., A1, A2, A3, . . ., B1, B2, B3,
 *  . . .
 *  
 *  
 *  SheetCollate = UNCOLLATED, MultipleDocumentHandling = SINGLE_DOCUMENT -- All the input docs will be
 *  combined into one output document. Multiple copies of the output document
 *  will be produced with pages in uncollated order, i.e. pages 1, 1, . . .,
 *  2, 2, . . ., 3, 3, . . .
 *  
 *  
 *  SheetCollate = UNCOLLATED, MultipleDocumentHandling = SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET -- All the input docs
 *  will be combined into one output document, and the first impression of each
 *  input doc will always start on a new media sheet. Multiple copies of the
 *  output document will be produced with pages in uncollated order, i.e. pages
 *  1, 1, . . ., 2, 2, . . ., 3, 3, . . .
 *  
 *  
 *  SheetCollate = UNCOLLATED, MultipleDocumentHandling = SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES -- Each
 *  input doc will remain a separate output document. Multiple copies of each
 *  output document (call them A, B, . . .) will be produced with each document's
 *  pages in uncollated order, with the documents themselves also in uncollated
 *  order, i.e. pages A1, A1, . . ., A2, A2, . . ., A3, A3, . . ., B1, B1, . . .,
 *  B2, B2, . . ., B3, B3, . . .
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  If different docs have different sheet collations specified, then only one
 *  value of MultipleDocumentHandling is
 *  permitted, and the printer reports an error when the job is submitted if any
 *  other value is specified:
 *  
 *  
 *  MultipleDocumentHandling =
 *  SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES -- Each input doc will remain a separate
 *  output document. Multiple copies of each output document (call them A, B,
 *  . . .) will be produced with each document's pages in collated or uncollated
 *  order as the corresponding input doc's SheetCollate attribute specifies, and
 *  with the documents themselves in uncollated order. If document A had
 *  SheetCollate = UNCOLLATED and document B had SheetCollate = COLLATED, the
 *  following pages would be produced: A1, A1, . . ., A2, A2, . . ., A3, A3,
 *  . . ., B1, B2, B3, . . ., B1, B2, B3, . . .
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  IPP Compatibility: SheetCollate is not an IPP attribute at present.
