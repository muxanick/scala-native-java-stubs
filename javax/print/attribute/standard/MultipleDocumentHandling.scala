/** Class MultipleDocumentHandling is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,
 *  that controls finishing operations and the placement of one or more
 *  print-stream pages into impressions and onto media sheets. When the value of
 *  the Copies attribute exceeds 1, MultipleDocumentHandling also
 *  controls the order in which the copies that result from processing the
 *  documents are produced. This attribute is relevant only for a multidoc print
 *  job consisting of two or more individual docs.
 *  
 *  Briefly, MultipleDocumentHandling determines the relationship between the
 *  multiple input (electronic) documents fed into a multidoc print job and the
 *  output (physical) document or documents produced by the multidoc print job.
 *  There are two possibilities:
 *  
 *  
 *  The multiple input documents are combined into a single output document.
 *  Finishing operations (Finishings),
 *  are performed on this single output
 *  document. The Copies attribute tells how many copies of this
 *  single output document to produce. The MultipleDocumentHandling values
 *  SINGLE_DOCUMENT and SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET specify two variations of
 *  this  possibility.
 *  
 *  
 *  The multiple input documents remain separate output documents. Finishing
 *  operations (Finishings),
 *  are performed on each output document
 *  separately. The Copies attribute tells how many copies of each
 *  separate output document to produce. The MultipleDocumentHandling values
 *  SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES and SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES
 *  specify two variations of this possibility.
 *  
 *  
 *  In the detailed explanations below, if "a" represents an
 *  instance of document data, then the result of processing the data in
 *  document "a" is a sequence of media sheets represented by
 *  "a(*)".
 *  
 *  The standard MultipleDocumentHandling values are:
 *  
 *  
 *  SINGLE_DOCUMENT. If a print job has multiple
 *  documents -- say, the document data is called a and
 *  b -- then the result of processing all the document data
 *  (a and then b) must be treated as a single sequence
 *  of media sheets for finishing operations; that is, finishing would be
 *  performed on the concatenation of the sequences a(*),b(*). The
 *  printer must not force the data in each document instance to be formatted
 *  onto a new print-stream page, nor to start a new impression on a new media
 *  sheet. If more than one copy is made, the ordering of the sets of media
 *  sheets resulting from processing the document data must be
 *  a(*),b(*),a(*),b(*),..., and the printer object must force
 *  each copy (a(*),b(*)) to start on a new media sheet.
 *  
 *  
 *  SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES. If a print job
 *  has multiple documents -- say, the document data is called a and
 *  b -- then the result of processing the data in each document
 *  instance must be treated as a single sequence of media sheets for finishing
 *  operations; that is, the sets a(*) and b(*) would
 *  each be finished separately. The printer must force each copy of the result
 *  of processing the data in a single document to start on a new media sheet.
 *  If more than one copy is made, the ordering of the sets of media sheets
 *  resulting from processing the document data must be
 *  a(*),a(*),...,b(*),b(*)....
 *  
 *  
 *  SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES. If a print job
 *  has multiple documents -- say, the document data is called a and
 *  b -- then the result of processing the data in each document
 *  instance must be treated as a single sequence of media sheets for finishing
 *  operations; that is, the sets a(*) and b(*) would
 *  each be finished separately. The printer must force each copy of the result
 *  of processing the data in a single document to start on a new media sheet.
 *  If more than one copy is made, the ordering of the sets of media sheets
 *  resulting from processing the document data must be
 *  a(*),b(*),a(*),b(*),....
 *  
 *  
 *  SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET. Same as SINGLE_DOCUMENT,
 *  except that the printer must ensure that the first impression of each
 *  document instance in the job is placed on a new media sheet. This value
 *  allows multiple documents to be stapled together with a single staple where
 *  each document starts on a new sheet.
 *  
 *  
 *  SINGLE_DOCUMENT is the same as SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES with
 *  respect to ordering of print-stream pages, but not media sheet generation,
 *  since SINGLE_DOCUMENT will put the first page of the next document on the
 *  back side of a sheet if an odd number of pages have been produced so far
 *  for the job, while SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES always forces the
 *  next document or document copy on to a new sheet.
 *  
 *  In addition, if a Finishings attribute of
 *  STAPLE is specified, then:
 *  
 *  
 *  With SINGLE_DOCUMENT, documents a and b are
 *  stapled together as a single document with no regard to new sheets.
 *  
 *  
 *  With SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET, documents a and b
 *  are stapled together as a single document, but document b
 *  starts on a new sheet.
 *  
 *  
 *  With SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES and
 *  SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES, documents a and
 *  b are stapled separately.
 *  
 *  
 *  Note: None of these values provide means to produce uncollated
 *  sheets within a document, i.e., where multiple copies of sheet n
 *  are produced before sheet n+1 of the same document.
 *  To specify that, see the SheetCollate attribute.
 *  
 *  IPP Compatibility: The category name returned by
 *  getName() is the IPP attribute name.  The enumeration's
 *  integer value is the IPP enum value.  The toString() method
 *  returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value.
