// A secret (symmetric) key.
// The purpose of this interface is to group (and provide type safety
// for) all secret key interfaces.
// 
// Provider implementations of this interface must overwrite the
// equals and hashCode methods inherited from
// Object, so that secret keys are compared based on
// their underlying key material and not based on reference.
// Implementations should override the default destroy and
// isDestroyed methods from the
// Destroyable interface to enable
// sensitive key information to be destroyed, cleared, or in the case
// where such information is immutable, unreferenced.
// Finally, since SecretKey is Serializable, implementations
// should also override
// ObjectOutputStream.writeObject(java.lang.Object)
// to prevent keys that have been destroyed from being serialized.
//
// Keys that implement this interface return the string RAW
// as their encoding format (see getFormat), and return the
// raw key bytes as the result of a getEncoded method call. (The
// getFormat and getEncoded methods are inherited
// from the Key parent interface.)
