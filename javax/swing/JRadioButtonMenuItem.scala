/** An implementation of a radio button menu item.
 *  A JRadioButtonMenuItem is
 *  a menu item that is part of a group of menu items in which only one
 *  item in the group can be selected. The selected item displays its
 *  selected state. Selecting it causes any other selected item to
 *  switch to the unselected state.
 *  To control the selected state of a group of radio button menu items,
 *  use a ButtonGroup object.
 *  
 *  Menu items can be configured, and to some degree controlled, by
 *  Actions.  Using an
 *  Action with a menu item has many benefits beyond directly
 *  configuring a menu item.  Refer to 
 *  Swing Components Supporting Action for more
 *  details, and you can find more information in How
 *  to Use Actions, a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  For further documentation and examples see
 *  How to Use Menus,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
