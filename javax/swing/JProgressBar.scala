/** A component that visually displays the progress of some task.  As the task
 *  progresses towards completion, the progress bar displays the
 *  task's percentage of completion.
 *  This percentage is typically represented visually by a rectangle which
 *  starts out empty and gradually becomes filled in as the task progresses.
 *  In addition, the progress bar can display a textual representation of this
 *  percentage.
 *  
 *  JProgressBar uses a BoundedRangeModel as its data model,
 *  with the value property representing the "current" state of the task,
 *  and the minimum and maximum properties representing the
 *  beginning and end points, respectively.
 *  
 *  To indicate that a task of unknown length is executing,
 *  you can put a progress bar into indeterminate mode.
 *  While the bar is in indeterminate mode,
 *  it animates constantly to show that work is occurring.
 *  As soon as you can determine the task's length and amount of progress,
 *  you should update the progress bar's value
 *  and switch it back to determinate mode.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  Here is an example of creating a progress bar,
 *  where task is an object (representing some piece of work)
 *  which returns information about the progress of the task:
 * 
 * 
 * progressBar = new JProgressBar(0, task.getLengthOfTask());
 * progressBar.setValue(0);
 * progressBar.setStringPainted(true);
 * 
 * 
 *  Here is an example of querying the current state of the task, and using
 *  the returned value to update the progress bar:
 * 
 * 
 * progressBar.setValue(task.getCurrent());
 * 
 * 
 *  Here is an example of putting a progress bar into
 *  indeterminate mode,
 *  and then switching back to determinate mode
 *  once the length of the task is known:
 * 
 * 
 * progressBar = new JProgressBar();
 * ...//when the task of (initially) unknown length begins:
 * progressBar.setIndeterminate(true);
 * ...//do some work; get length of task...
 * progressBar.setMaximum(newLength);
 * progressBar.setValue(newValue);
 * progressBar.setIndeterminate(false);
 * 
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  For complete examples and further documentation see
 *  How to Monitor Progress,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
