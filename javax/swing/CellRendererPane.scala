/** This class is inserted in between cell renderers and the components that
 *  use them.  It just exists to thwart the repaint() and invalidate() methods
 *  which would otherwise propagate up the tree when the renderer was configured.
 *  It's used by the implementations of JTable, JTree, and JList.  For example,
 *  here's how CellRendererPane is used in the code the paints each row
 *  in a JList:
 *  
 *    cellRendererPane = new CellRendererPane();
 *    ...
 *    Component rendererComponent = renderer.getListCellRendererComponent();
 *    renderer.configureListCellRenderer(dataModel.getElementAt(row), row);
 *    cellRendererPane.paintComponent(g, rendererComponent, this, x, y, w, h);
 *  
 *  
 *  A renderer component must override isShowing() and unconditionally return
 *  true to work correctly because the Swing paint does nothing for components
 *  with isShowing false.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
