// This class is inserted in between cell renderers and the components that
// use them.  It just exists to thwart the repaint() and invalidate() methods
// which would otherwise propagate up the tree when the renderer was configured.
// It's used by the implementations of JTable, JTree, and JList.  For example,
// here's how CellRendererPane is used in the code the paints each row
// in a JList:
// 
//   cellRendererPane = new CellRendererPane();
//   ...
//   Component rendererComponent = renderer.getListCellRendererComponent();
//   renderer.configureListCellRenderer(dataModel.getElementAt(row), row);
//   cellRendererPane.paintComponent(g, rendererComponent, this, x, y, w, h);
// 
// 
// A renderer component must override isShowing() and unconditionally return
// true to work correctly because the Swing paint does nothing for components
// with isShowing false.
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
