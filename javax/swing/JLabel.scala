/** A display area for a short text string or an image,
 *  or both.
 *  A label does not react to input events.
 *  As a result, it cannot get the keyboard focus.
 *  A label can, however, display a keyboard alternative
 *  as a convenience for a nearby component
 *  that has a keyboard alternative but can't display it.
 *  
 *  A JLabel object can display
 *  either text, an image, or both.
 *  You can specify where in the label's display area
 *  the label's contents are aligned
 *  by setting the vertical and horizontal alignment.
 *  By default, labels are vertically centered
 *  in their display area.
 *  Text-only labels are leading edge aligned, by default;
 *  image-only labels are horizontally centered, by default.
 *  
 *  You can also specify the position of the text
 *  relative to the image.
 *  By default, text is on the trailing edge of the image,
 *  with the text and image vertically aligned.
 *  
 *  A label's leading and trailing edge are determined from the value of its
 *  ComponentOrientation property.  At present, the default
 *  ComponentOrientation setting maps the leading edge to left and the trailing
 *  edge to right.
 * 
 *  
 *  Finally, you can use the setIconTextGap method
 *  to specify how many pixels
 *  should appear between the text and the image.
 *  The default is 4 pixels.
 *  
 *  See How to Use Labels
 *  in The Java Tutorial
 *  for further documentation.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
