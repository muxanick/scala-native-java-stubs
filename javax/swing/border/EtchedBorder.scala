/** A class which implements a simple etched border which can
 *  either be etched-in or etched-out.  If no highlight/shadow
 *  colors are initialized when the border is created, then
 *  these colors will be dynamically derived from the background
 *  color of the component argument passed into the paintBorder()
 *  method.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
