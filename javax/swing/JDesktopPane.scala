/** A container used to create a multiple-document interface or a virtual desktop.
 *  You create JInternalFrame objects and add them to the
 *  JDesktopPane. JDesktopPane extends
 *  JLayeredPane to manage the potentially overlapping internal
 *  frames. It also maintains a reference to an instance of
 *  DesktopManager that is set by the UI
 *  class for the current look and feel (L&F).  Note that JDesktopPane
 *  does not support borders.
 *  
 *  This class is normally used as the parent of JInternalFrames
 *  to provide a pluggable DesktopManager object to the
 *  JInternalFrames. The installUI of the
 *  L&F specific implementation is responsible for setting the
 *  desktopManager variable appropriately.
 *  When the parent of a JInternalFrame is a JDesktopPane,
 *  it should delegate most of its behavior to the desktopManager
 *  (closing, resizing, etc).
 *  
 *  For further documentation and examples see
 *  How to Use Internal Frames,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
