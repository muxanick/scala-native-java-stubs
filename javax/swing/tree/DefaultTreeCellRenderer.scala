/** Displays an entry in a tree.
 *  DefaultTreeCellRenderer is not opaque and
 *  unless you subclass paint you should not change this.
 *  See How to Use Trees
 *  in The Java Tutorial
 *  for examples of customizing node display using this class.
 *  
 *  The set of icons and colors used by DefaultTreeCellRenderer
 *  can be configured using the various setter methods. The value for
 *  each property is initialized from the defaults table. When the
 *  look and feel changes (updateUI is invoked), any properties
 *  that have a value of type UIResource are refreshed from the
 *  defaults table. The following table lists the mapping between
 *  DefaultTreeCellRenderer property and defaults table key:
 *  
 *    
 *      Property:
 *      Key:
 *    "leafIcon""Tree.leafIcon"
 *    "closedIcon""Tree.closedIcon"
 *    "openIcon""Tree.openIcon"
 *    "textSelectionColor""Tree.selectionForeground"
 *    "textNonSelectionColor""Tree.textForeground"
 *    "backgroundSelectionColor""Tree.selectionBackground"
 *    "backgroundNonSelectionColor""Tree.textBackground"
 *    "borderSelectionColor""Tree.selectionBorderColor"
 *  
 *  
 *  Implementation Note:
 *  This class overrides
 *  invalidate,
 *  validate,
 *  revalidate,
 *  repaint,
 *  and
 *  firePropertyChange
 *  solely to improve performance.
 *  If not overridden, these frequently called methods would execute code paths
 *  that are unnecessary for the default tree cell renderer.
 *  If you write your own renderer,
 *  take care to weigh the benefits and
 *  drawbacks of overriding these methods.
 * 
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
