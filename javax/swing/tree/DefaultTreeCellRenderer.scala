// Displays an entry in a tree.
// DefaultTreeCellRenderer is not opaque and
// unless you subclass paint you should not change this.
// See How to Use Trees
// in The Java Tutorial
// for examples of customizing node display using this class.
// 
// The set of icons and colors used by DefaultTreeCellRenderer
// can be configured using the various setter methods. The value for
// each property is initialized from the defaults table. When the
// look and feel changes (updateUI is invoked), any properties
// that have a value of type UIResource are refreshed from the
// defaults table. The following table lists the mapping between
// DefaultTreeCellRenderer property and defaults table key:
// 
//   
//     Property:
//     Key:
//   "leafIcon""Tree.leafIcon"
//   "closedIcon""Tree.closedIcon"
//   "openIcon""Tree.openIcon"
//   "textSelectionColor""Tree.selectionForeground"
//   "textNonSelectionColor""Tree.textForeground"
//   "backgroundSelectionColor""Tree.selectionBackground"
//   "backgroundNonSelectionColor""Tree.textBackground"
//   "borderSelectionColor""Tree.selectionBorderColor"
// 
// 
// Implementation Note:
// This class overrides
// invalidate,
// validate,
// revalidate,
// repaint,
// and
// firePropertyChange
// solely to improve performance.
// If not overridden, these frequently called methods would execute code paths
// that are unnecessary for the default tree cell renderer.
// If you write your own renderer,
// take care to weigh the benefits and
// drawbacks of overriding these methods.
//
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
