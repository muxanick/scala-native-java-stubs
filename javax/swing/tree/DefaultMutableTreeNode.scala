/** A DefaultMutableTreeNode is a general-purpose node in a tree data
 *  structure.
 *  For examples of using default mutable tree nodes, see
 *  How to Use Trees
 *  in The Java Tutorial.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  A tree node may have at most one parent and 0 or more children.
 *  DefaultMutableTreeNode provides operations for examining and modifying a
 *  node's parent and children and also operations for examining the tree that
 *  the node is a part of.  A node's tree is the set of all nodes that can be
 *  reached by starting at the node and following all the possible links to
 *  parents and children.  A node with no parent is the root of its tree; a
 *  node with no children is a leaf.  A tree may consist of many subtrees,
 *  each node acting as the root for its own subtree.
 *  
 *  This class provides enumerations for efficiently traversing a tree or
 *  subtree in various orders or for following the path between two nodes.
 *  A DefaultMutableTreeNode may also hold a reference to a user object, the
 *  use of which is left to the user.  Asking a DefaultMutableTreeNode for its
 *  string representation with toString() returns the string
 *  representation of its user object.
 *  
 *  This is not a thread safe class.If you intend to use
 *  a DefaultMutableTreeNode (or a tree of TreeNodes) in more than one thread, you
 *  need to do your own synchronizing. A good convention to adopt is
 *  synchronizing on the root node of a tree.
 *  
 *  While DefaultMutableTreeNode implements the MutableTreeNode interface and
 *  will allow you to add in any implementation of MutableTreeNode not all
 *  of the methods in DefaultMutableTreeNode will be applicable to all
 *  MutableTreeNodes implementations. Especially with some of the enumerations
 *  that are provided, using some of these methods assumes the
 *  DefaultMutableTreeNode contains only DefaultMutableNode instances. All
 *  of the TreeNode/MutableTreeNode methods will behave as defined no
 *  matter what implementations are added.
 * 
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
