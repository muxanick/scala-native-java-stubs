// A DefaultMutableTreeNode is a general-purpose node in a tree data
// structure.
// For examples of using default mutable tree nodes, see
// How to Use Trees
// in The Java Tutorial.
//
// 
//
// A tree node may have at most one parent and 0 or more children.
// DefaultMutableTreeNode provides operations for examining and modifying a
// node's parent and children and also operations for examining the tree that
// the node is a part of.  A node's tree is the set of all nodes that can be
// reached by starting at the node and following all the possible links to
// parents and children.  A node with no parent is the root of its tree; a
// node with no children is a leaf.  A tree may consist of many subtrees,
// each node acting as the root for its own subtree.
// 
// This class provides enumerations for efficiently traversing a tree or
// subtree in various orders or for following the path between two nodes.
// A DefaultMutableTreeNode may also hold a reference to a user object, the
// use of which is left to the user.  Asking a DefaultMutableTreeNode for its
// string representation with toString() returns the string
// representation of its user object.
// 
// This is not a thread safe class.If you intend to use
// a DefaultMutableTreeNode (or a tree of TreeNodes) in more than one thread, you
// need to do your own synchronizing. A good convention to adopt is
// synchronizing on the root node of a tree.
// 
// While DefaultMutableTreeNode implements the MutableTreeNode interface and
// will allow you to add in any implementation of MutableTreeNode not all
// of the methods in DefaultMutableTreeNode will be applicable to all
// MutableTreeNodes implementations. Especially with some of the enumerations
// that are provided, using some of these methods assumes the
// DefaultMutableTreeNode contains only DefaultMutableNode instances. All
// of the TreeNode/MutableTreeNode methods will behave as defined no
// matter what implementations are added.
//
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
