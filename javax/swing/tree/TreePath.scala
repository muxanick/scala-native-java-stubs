// TreePath represents an array of objects that uniquely
// identify the path to a node in a tree. The elements of the array
// are ordered with the root as the first element of the array. For
// example, a file on the file system is uniquely identified based on
// the array of parent directories and the name of the file. The path
// /tmp/foo/bar could be represented by a TreePath as
// new TreePath(new Object[] {"tmp", "foo", "bar"}).
// 
// TreePath is used extensively by JTree and related classes.
// For example, JTree represents the selection as an array of
// TreePaths. When used with JTree, the elements of the
// path are the objects returned from the TreeModel. When JTree
// is paired with DefaultTreeModel, the elements of the
// path are TreeNodes. The following example illustrates extracting
// the user object from the selection of a JTree:
// 
//   DefaultMutableTreeNode root = ...;
//   DefaultTreeModel model = new DefaultTreeModel(root);
//   JTree tree = new JTree(model);
//   ...
//   TreePath selectedPath = tree.getSelectionPath();
//   DefaultMutableTreeNode selectedNode =
//       ((DefaultMutableTreeNode)selectedPath.getLastPathComponent()).
//       getUserObject();
// 
// Subclasses typically need override only getLastPathComponent, and getParentPath. As JTree
// internally creates TreePaths at various points, it's
// generally not useful to subclass TreePath and use with
// JTree.
// 
// While TreePath is serializable, a NotSerializableException is thrown if any elements of the path are
// not serializable.
// 
// For further information and examples of using tree paths,
// see How to Use Trees
// in The Java Tutorial.
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
