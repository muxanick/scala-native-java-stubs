/** TreePath represents an array of objects that uniquely
 *  identify the path to a node in a tree. The elements of the array
 *  are ordered with the root as the first element of the array. For
 *  example, a file on the file system is uniquely identified based on
 *  the array of parent directories and the name of the file. The path
 *  /tmp/foo/bar could be represented by a TreePath as
 *  new TreePath(new Object[] {"tmp", "foo", "bar"}).
 *  
 *  TreePath is used extensively by JTree and related classes.
 *  For example, JTree represents the selection as an array of
 *  TreePaths. When used with JTree, the elements of the
 *  path are the objects returned from the TreeModel. When JTree
 *  is paired with DefaultTreeModel, the elements of the
 *  path are TreeNodes. The following example illustrates extracting
 *  the user object from the selection of a JTree:
 *  
 *    DefaultMutableTreeNode root = ...;
 *    DefaultTreeModel model = new DefaultTreeModel(root);
 *    JTree tree = new JTree(model);
 *    ...
 *    TreePath selectedPath = tree.getSelectionPath();
 *    DefaultMutableTreeNode selectedNode =
 *        ((DefaultMutableTreeNode)selectedPath.getLastPathComponent()).
 *        getUserObject();
 *  
 *  Subclasses typically need override only getLastPathComponent, and getParentPath. As JTree
 *  internally creates TreePaths at various points, it's
 *  generally not useful to subclass TreePath and use with
 *  JTree.
 *  
 *  While TreePath is serializable, a NotSerializableException is thrown if any elements of the path are
 *  not serializable.
 *  
 *  For further information and examples of using tree paths,
 *  see How to Use Trees
 *  in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
