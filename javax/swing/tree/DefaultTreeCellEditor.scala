/** A TreeCellEditor. You need to supply an
 *  instance of DefaultTreeCellRenderer
 *  so that the icons can be obtained. You can optionally supply
 *  a TreeCellEditor that will be layed out according
 *  to the icon in the DefaultTreeCellRenderer.
 *  If you do not supply a TreeCellEditor,
 *  a TextField will be used. Editing is started
 *  on a triple mouse click, or after a click, pause, click and
 *  a delay of 1200 milliseconds.
 * 
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
