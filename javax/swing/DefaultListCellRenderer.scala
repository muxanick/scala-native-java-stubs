/** Renders an item in a list.
 *  
 *  Implementation Note:
 *  This class overrides
 *  invalidate,
 *  validate,
 *  revalidate,
 *  repaint,
 *  isOpaque,
 *  and
 *  firePropertyChange
 *  solely to improve performance.
 *  If not overridden, these frequently called methods would execute code paths
 *  that are unnecessary for the default list cell renderer.
 *  If you write your own renderer,
 *  take care to weigh the benefits and
 *  drawbacks of overriding these methods.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
