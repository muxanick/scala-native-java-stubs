/** An implementation of a radio button -- an item that can be selected or
 *  deselected, and which displays its state to the user.
 *  Used with a ButtonGroup object to create a group of buttons
 *  in which only one button at a time can be selected. (Create a ButtonGroup
 *  object and use its add method to include the JRadioButton objects
 *  in the group.)
 *  
 *  Note:
 *  The ButtonGroup object is a logical grouping -- not a physical grouping.
 *  To create a button panel, you should still create a JPanel or similar
 *  container-object and add a Border to it to set it off from surrounding
 *  components.
 *  
 *  
 *  Buttons can be configured, and to some degree controlled, by
 *  Actions.  Using an
 *  Action with a button has many benefits beyond directly
 *  configuring a button.  Refer to 
 *  Swing Components Supporting Action for more
 *  details, and you can find more information in How
 *  to Use Actions, a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  See How to Use Buttons, Check Boxes, and Radio Buttons
 *  in The Java Tutorial
 *  for further documentation.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
