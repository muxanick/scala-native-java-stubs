/** A lightweight container
 *  that uses a BoxLayout object as its layout manager.
 *  Box provides several class methods
 *  that are useful for containers using BoxLayout --
 *  even non-Box containers.
 * 
 *  
 *  The Box class can create several kinds
 *  of invisible components
 *  that affect layout:
 *  glue, struts, and rigid areas.
 *  If all the components your Box contains
 *  have a fixed size,
 *  you might want to use a glue component
 *  (returned by createGlue)
 *  to control the components' positions.
 *  If you need a fixed amount of space between two components,
 *  try using a strut
 *  (createHorizontalStrut or createVerticalStrut).
 *  If you need an invisible component
 *  that always takes up the same amount of space,
 *  get it by invoking createRigidArea.
 *  
 *  If you are implementing a BoxLayout you
 *  can find further information and examples in
 *  How to Use BoxLayout,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
