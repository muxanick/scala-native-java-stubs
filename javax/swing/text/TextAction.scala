// An Action implementation useful for key bindings that are
// shared across a number of different text components.  Because
// the action is shared, it must have a way of getting it's
// target to act upon.  This class provides support to try and
// find a text component to operate on.  The preferred way of
// getting the component to act upon is through the ActionEvent
// that is received.  If the Object returned by getSource can
// be narrowed to a text component, it will be used.  If the
// action event is null or can't be narrowed, the last focused
// text component is tried.  This is determined by being
// used in conjunction with a JTextController which
// arranges to share that information with a TextAction.
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
