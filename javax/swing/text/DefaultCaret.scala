/** A default implementation of Caret.  The caret is rendered as
 *  a vertical line in the color specified by the CaretColor property
 *  of the associated JTextComponent.  It can blink at the rate specified
 *  by the BlinkRate property.
 *  
 *  This implementation expects two sources of asynchronous notification.
 *  The timer thread fires asynchronously, and causes the caret to simply
 *  repaint the most recent bounding box.  The caret also tracks change
 *  as the document is modified.  Typically this will happen on the
 *  event dispatch thread as a result of some mouse or keyboard event.
 *  The caret behavior on both synchronous and asynchronous documents updates
 *  is controlled by UpdatePolicy property. The repaint of the
 *  new caret location will occur on the event thread in any case, as calls to
 *  modelToView are only safe on the event thread.
 *  
 *  The caret acts as a mouse and focus listener on the text component
 *  it has been installed in, and defines the caret semantics based upon
 *  those events.  The listener methods can be reimplemented to change the
 *  semantics.
 *  By default, the first mouse button will be used to set focus and caret
 *  position.  Dragging the mouse pointer with the first mouse button will
 *  sweep out a selection that is contiguous in the model.  If the associated
 *  text component is editable, the caret will become visible when focus
 *  is gained, and invisible when focus is lost.
 *  
 *  The Highlighter bound to the associated text component is used to
 *  render the selection by default.
 *  Selection appearance can be customized by supplying a
 *  painter to use for the highlights.  By default a painter is used that
 *  will render a solid color as specified in the associated text component
 *  in the SelectionColor property.  This can easily be changed
 *  by reimplementing the
 *  getSelectionPainter
 *  method.
 *  
 *  A customized caret appearance can be achieved by reimplementing
 *  the paint method.  If the paint method is changed, the damage method
 *  should also be reimplemented to cause a repaint for the area needed
 *  to render the caret.  The caret extends the Rectangle class which
 *  is used to hold the bounding box for where the caret was last rendered.
 *  This enables the caret to repaint in a thread-safe manner when the
 *  caret moves without making a call to modelToView which is unstable
 *  between model updates and view repair (i.e. the order of delivery
 *  to DocumentListeners is not guaranteed).
 *  
 *  The magic caret position is set to null when the caret position changes.
 *  A timer is used to determine the new location (after the caret change).
 *  When the timer fires, if the magic caret position is still null it is
 *  reset to the current caret position. Any actions that change
 *  the caret position and want the magic caret position to remain the
 *  same, must remember the magic caret position, change the cursor, and
 *  then set the magic caret position to its original value. This has the
 *  benefit that only actions that want the magic caret position to persist
 *  (such as open/down) need to know about it.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
