// A default implementation of Caret.  The caret is rendered as
// a vertical line in the color specified by the CaretColor property
// of the associated JTextComponent.  It can blink at the rate specified
// by the BlinkRate property.
// 
// This implementation expects two sources of asynchronous notification.
// The timer thread fires asynchronously, and causes the caret to simply
// repaint the most recent bounding box.  The caret also tracks change
// as the document is modified.  Typically this will happen on the
// event dispatch thread as a result of some mouse or keyboard event.
// The caret behavior on both synchronous and asynchronous documents updates
// is controlled by UpdatePolicy property. The repaint of the
// new caret location will occur on the event thread in any case, as calls to
// modelToView are only safe on the event thread.
// 
// The caret acts as a mouse and focus listener on the text component
// it has been installed in, and defines the caret semantics based upon
// those events.  The listener methods can be reimplemented to change the
// semantics.
// By default, the first mouse button will be used to set focus and caret
// position.  Dragging the mouse pointer with the first mouse button will
// sweep out a selection that is contiguous in the model.  If the associated
// text component is editable, the caret will become visible when focus
// is gained, and invisible when focus is lost.
// 
// The Highlighter bound to the associated text component is used to
// render the selection by default.
// Selection appearance can be customized by supplying a
// painter to use for the highlights.  By default a painter is used that
// will render a solid color as specified in the associated text component
// in the SelectionColor property.  This can easily be changed
// by reimplementing the
// getSelectionPainter
// method.
// 
// A customized caret appearance can be achieved by reimplementing
// the paint method.  If the paint method is changed, the damage method
// should also be reimplemented to cause a repaint for the area needed
// to render the caret.  The caret extends the Rectangle class which
// is used to hold the bounding box for where the caret was last rendered.
// This enables the caret to repaint in a thread-safe manner when the
// caret moves without making a call to modelToView which is unstable
// between model updates and view repair (i.e. the order of delivery
// to DocumentListeners is not guaranteed).
// 
// The magic caret position is set to null when the caret position changes.
// A timer is used to determine the new location (after the caret change).
// When the timer fires, if the magic caret position is still null it is
// reset to the current caret position. Any actions that change
// the caret position and want the magic caret position to remain the
// same, must remember the magic caret position, change the cursor, and
// then set the magic caret position to its original value. This has the
// benefit that only actions that want the magic caret position to persist
// (such as open/down) need to know about it.
//
