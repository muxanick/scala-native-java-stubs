/** ZoneView is a View implementation that creates zones for which
 *  the child views are not created or stored until they are needed
 *  for display or model/view translations.  This enables a substantial
 *  reduction in memory consumption for situations where the model
 *  being represented is very large, by building view objects only for
 *  the region being actively viewed/edited.  The size of the children
 *  can be estimated in some way, or calculated asynchronously with
 *  only the result being saved.
 *  
 *  ZoneView extends BoxView to provide a box that implements
 *  zones for its children.  The zones are special View implementations
 *  (the children of an instance of this class) that represent only a
 *  portion of the model that an instance of ZoneView is responsible
 *  for.  The zones don't create child views until an attempt is made
 *  to display them. A box shaped view is well suited to this because:
 *    
 *    
 *    Boxes are a heavily used view, and having a box that
 *    provides this behavior gives substantial opportunity
 *    to plug the behavior into a view hierarchy from the
 *    view factory.
 *    
 *    Boxes are tiled in one direction, so it is easy to
 *    divide them into zones in a reliable way.
 *    
 *    Boxes typically have a simple relationship to the model (i.e. they
 *    create child views that directly represent the child elements).
 *    
 *    Boxes are easier to estimate the size of than some other shapes.
 *    
 *  
 *  The default behavior is controlled by two properties, maxZoneSize
 *  and maxZonesLoaded.  Setting maxZoneSize to Integer.MAX_VALUE would
 *  have the effect of causing only one zone to be created.  This would
 *  effectively turn the view into an implementation of the decorator
 *  pattern.  Setting maxZonesLoaded to a value of Integer.MAX_VALUE would
 *  cause zones to never be unloaded.  For simplicity, zones are created on
 *  boundaries represented by the child elements of the element the view is
 *  responsible for.  The zones can be any View implementation, but the
 *  default implementation is based upon AsyncBoxView which supports fairly
 *  large zones efficiently.
