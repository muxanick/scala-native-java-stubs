// ZoneView is a View implementation that creates zones for which
// the child views are not created or stored until they are needed
// for display or model/view translations.  This enables a substantial
// reduction in memory consumption for situations where the model
// being represented is very large, by building view objects only for
// the region being actively viewed/edited.  The size of the children
// can be estimated in some way, or calculated asynchronously with
// only the result being saved.
// 
// ZoneView extends BoxView to provide a box that implements
// zones for its children.  The zones are special View implementations
// (the children of an instance of this class) that represent only a
// portion of the model that an instance of ZoneView is responsible
// for.  The zones don't create child views until an attempt is made
// to display them. A box shaped view is well suited to this because:
//   
//   
//   Boxes are a heavily used view, and having a box that
//   provides this behavior gives substantial opportunity
//   to plug the behavior into a view hierarchy from the
//   view factory.
//   
//   Boxes are tiled in one direction, so it is easy to
//   divide them into zones in a reliable way.
//   
//   Boxes typically have a simple relationship to the model (i.e. they
//   create child views that directly represent the child elements).
//   
//   Boxes are easier to estimate the size of than some other shapes.
//   
// 
// The default behavior is controlled by two properties, maxZoneSize
// and maxZonesLoaded.  Setting maxZoneSize to Integer.MAX_VALUE would
// have the effect of causing only one zone to be created.  This would
// effectively turn the view into an implementation of the decorator
// pattern.  Setting maxZonesLoaded to a value of Integer.MAX_VALUE would
// cause zones to never be unloaded.  For simplicity, zones are created on
// boundaries represented by the child elements of the element the view is
// responsible for.  The zones can be any View implementation, but the
// default implementation is based upon AsyncBoxView which supports fairly
// large zones efficiently.
