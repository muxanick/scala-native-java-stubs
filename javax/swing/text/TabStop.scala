// This class encapsulates a single tab stop (basically as tab stops
// are thought of by RTF). A tab stop is at a specified distance from the
// left margin, aligns text in a specified way, and has a specified leader.
// TabStops are immutable, and usually contained in TabSets.
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
