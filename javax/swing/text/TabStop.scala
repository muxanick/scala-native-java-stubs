/** This class encapsulates a single tab stop (basically as tab stops
 *  are thought of by RTF). A tab stop is at a specified distance from the
 *  left margin, aligns text in a specified way, and has a specified leader.
 *  TabStops are immutable, and usually contained in TabSets.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
