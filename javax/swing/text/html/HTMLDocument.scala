/** A document that models HTML.  The purpose of this model is to
 *  support both browsing and editing.  As a result, the structure
 *  described by an HTML document is not exactly replicated by default.
 *  The element structure that is modeled by default, is built by the
 *  class HTMLDocument.HTMLReader, which implements the
 *  HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback protocol that the parser
 *  expects.  To change the structure one can subclass
 *  HTMLReader, and reimplement the method getReader(int) to return the new reader implementation.  The
 *  documentation for HTMLReader should be consulted for
 *  the details of the default structure created.  The intent is that
 *  the document be non-lossy (although reproducing the HTML format may
 *  result in a different format).
 * 
 *  The document models only HTML, and makes no attempt to store
 *  view attributes in it.  The elements are identified by the
 *  StyleContext.NameAttribute attribute, which should
 *  always have a value of type HTML.Tag that identifies
 *  the kind of element.  Some of the elements (such as comments) are
 *  synthesized.  The HTMLFactory uses this attribute to
 *  determine what kind of view to build.
 * 
 *  This document supports incremental loading.  The
 *  TokenThreshold property controls how much of the parse
 *  is buffered before trying to update the element structure of the
 *  document.  This property is set by the EditorKit so
 *  that subclasses can disable it.
 * 
 *  The Base property determines the URL against which
 *  relative URLs are resolved.  By default, this will be the
 *  Document.StreamDescriptionProperty if the value of the
 *  property is a URL.  If a <BASE> tag is encountered, the base
 *  will become the URL specified by that tag.  Because the base URL is
 *  a property, it can of course be set directly.
 * 
 *  The default content storage mechanism for this document is a gap
 *  buffer (GapContent).  Alternatives can be supplied by
 *  using the constructor that takes a Content
 *  implementation.
 * 
 *  Modifying HTMLDocument
 * 
 *  In addition to the methods provided by Document and
 *  StyledDocument for mutating an HTMLDocument, HTMLDocument provides
 *  a number of convenience methods.  The following methods can be used
 *  to insert HTML content into an existing document.
 * 
 *  
 *    setInnerHTML(Element, String)
 *    setOuterHTML(Element, String)
 *    insertBeforeStart(Element, String)
 *    insertAfterStart(Element, String)
 *    insertBeforeEnd(Element, String)
 *    insertAfterEnd(Element, String)
 *  
 * 
 *  The following examples illustrate using these methods.  Each
 *  example assumes the HTML document is initialized in the following
 *  way:
 * 
 *  
 *  JEditorPane p = new JEditorPane();
 *  p.setContentType("text/html");
 *  p.setText("..."); // Document text is provided below.
 *  HTMLDocument d = (HTMLDocument) p.getDocument();
 *  
 * 
 *  With the following HTML content:
 * 
 *  
 *  <html>
 *    <head>
 *      <title>An example HTMLDocument</title>
 *      <style type="text/css">
 *        div { background-color: silver; }
 *        ul { color: red; }
 *      </style>
 *    </head>
 *    <body>
 *      <div id="BOX">
 *        <p>Paragraph 1</p>
 *        <p>Paragraph 2</p>
 *      </div>
 *    </body>
 *  </html>
 *  
 * 
 *  All the methods for modifying an HTML document require an Element.  Elements can be obtained from an HTML document by using
 *  the method getElement(Element e, Object attribute, Object
 *  value).  It returns the first descendant element that contains the
 *  specified attribute with the given value, in depth-first order.
 *  For example, d.getElement(d.getDefaultRootElement(),
 *  StyleConstants.NameAttribute, HTML.Tag.P) returns the first
 *  paragraph element.
 * 
 *  A convenient shortcut for locating elements is the method getElement(String); returns an element whose ID
 *  attribute matches the specified value.  For example,
 *  d.getElement("BOX") returns the DIV
 *  element.
 * 
 *  The getIterator(HTML.Tag t) method can also be used for
 *  finding all occurrences of the specified HTML tag in the
 *  document.
 * 
 *  Inserting elements
 * 
 *  Elements can be inserted before or after the existing children
 *  of any non-leaf element by using the methods
 *  insertAfterStart and insertBeforeEnd.
 *  For example, if e is the DIV element,
 *  d.insertAfterStart(e, "<ul><li>List
 *  Item</li></ul>") inserts the list before the first
 *  paragraph, and d.insertBeforeEnd(e, "<ul><li>List
 *  Item</li></ul>") inserts the list after the last
 *  paragraph.  The DIV block becomes the parent of the
 *  newly inserted elements.
 * 
 *  Sibling elements can be inserted before or after any element by
 *  using the methods insertBeforeStart and
 *  insertAfterEnd.  For example, if e is the
 *  DIV element, d.insertBeforeStart(e,
 *  "<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>") inserts the list
 *  before the DIV element, and d.insertAfterEnd(e,
 *  "<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>") inserts the list
 *  after the DIV element.  The newly inserted elements
 *  become siblings of the DIV element.
 * 
 *  Replacing elements
 * 
 *  Elements and all their descendants can be replaced by using the
 *  methods setInnerHTML and setOuterHTML.
 *  For example, if e is the DIV element,
 *  d.setInnerHTML(e, "<ul><li>List
 *  Item</li></ul>") replaces all children paragraphs with
 *  the list, and d.setOuterHTML(e, "<ul><li>List
 *  Item</li></ul>") replaces the DIV element
 *  itself.  In latter case the parent of the list is the
 *  BODY element.
 *

 *  of various methods described above.

    /** An HTML reader to load an HTML document with an HTML
     *  element structure.  This is a set of callbacks from
     *  the parser, implemented to create a set of elements
     *  tagged with attributes.  The parse builds up tokens
     *  (ElementSpec) that describe the element subtree desired,
     *  and burst it into the document under the protection of
     *  a write lock using the insert method on the document
     *  outer class.
     *  
     *  The reader can be configured by registering actions
     *  (of type HTMLDocument.HTMLReader.TagAction)
     *  that describe how to handle the action.  The idea behind
     *  the actions provided is that the most natural text editing
     *  operations can be provided if the element structure boils
     *  down to paragraphs with runs of some kind of style
     *  in them.  Some things are more naturally specified
     *  structurally, so arbitrary structure should be allowed
     *  above the paragraphs, but will need to be edited with structural
     *  actions.  The implication of this is that some of the
     *  HTML elements specified in the stream being parsed will
     *  be collapsed into attributes, and in some cases paragraphs
     *  will be synthesized.  When HTML elements have been
     *  converted to attributes, the attribute key will be of
     *  type HTML.Tag, and the value will be of type AttributeSet
     *  so that no information is lost.  This enables many of the
     *  existing actions to work so that the user can type input,
     *  hit the return key, backspace, delete, etc and have a
     *  reasonable result.  Selections can be created, and attributes
     *  applied or removed, etc.  With this in mind, the work done
     *  by the reader can be categorized into the following kinds
     *  of tasks:
     *  
     *  Block
     *  Build the structure like it's specified in the stream.
     *  This produces elements that contain other elements.
     *  Paragraph
     *  Like block except that it's expected that the element
     *  will be used with a paragraph view so a paragraph element
     *  won't need to be synthesized.
     *  Character
     *  Contribute the element as an attribute that will start
     *  and stop at arbitrary text locations.  This will ultimately
     *  be mixed into a run of text, with all of the currently
     *  flattened HTML character elements.
     *  Special
     *  Produce an embedded graphical element.
     *  Form
     *  Produce an element that is like the embedded graphical
     *  element, except that it also has a component model associated
     *  with it.
     *  Hidden
     *  Create an element that is hidden from view when the
     *  document is being viewed read-only, and visible when the
     *  document is being edited.  This is useful to keep the
     *  model from losing information, and used to store things
     *  like comments and unrecognized tags.
     * 
     *

     *  <SCRIPT> and <STYLE> are unsupported.
