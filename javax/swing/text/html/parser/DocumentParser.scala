package javax.swing.text.html.parser

import java.lang.{Object, String}

/** A Parser for HTML Documents (actually, you can specify a DTD, but
 *  you should really only use this class with the html dtd in swing).
 *  Reads an InputStream of HTML and
 *  invokes the appropriate methods in the ParserCallback class. This
 *  is the default parser used by HTMLEditorKit to parse HTML url's.
 *  This will message the callback for all valid tags, as well as
 *  tags that are implied but not explicitly specified. For example, the
 *  html string (<p>blah) only has a p tag defined. The callback
 *  will see the following methods:
 *  handleStartTag(html, ...)
 *      handleStartTag(head, ...)
 *      handleEndTag(head)
 *      handleStartTag(body, ...)
 *      handleStartTag(p, ...)
 *      handleText(...)
 *      handleEndTag(p)
 *      handleEndTag(body)
 *      handleEndTag(html)
 *  
 *  The items in italic are implied, that is, although they were not
 *  explicitly specified, to be correct html they should have been present
 *  (head isn't necessary, but it is still generated). For tags that
 *  are implied, the AttributeSet argument will have a value of
 *  Boolean.TRUE for the key
 *  HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback.IMPLIED.
 *  HTML.Attributes defines a type safe enumeration of html attributes.
 *  If an attribute key of a tag is defined in HTML.Attribute, the
 *  HTML.Attribute will be used as the key, otherwise a String will be used.
 *  For example <p foo=bar class=neat> has two attributes. foo is
 *  not defined in HTML.Attribute, where as class is, therefore the
 *  AttributeSet will have two values in it, HTML.Attribute.CLASS with
 *  a String value of 'neat' and the String key 'foo' with a String value of
 *  'bar'.
 *  The position argument will indicate the start of the tag, comment
 *  or text. Similar to arrays, the first character in the stream has a
 *  position of 0. For tags that are
 *  implied the position will indicate
 *  the location of the next encountered tag. In the first example,
 *  the implied start body and html tags will have the same position as the
 *  p tag, and the implied end p, html and body tags will all have the same
 *  position.
 *  As html skips whitespace the position for text will be the position
 *  of the first valid character, eg in the string '\n\n\nblah'
 *  the text 'blah' will have a position of 3, the newlines are skipped.
 *  
 *  For attributes that do not have a value, eg in the html
 *  string <foo blah> the attribute blah
 *  does not have a value, there are two possible values that will be
 *  placed in the AttributeSet's value:
 *  
 *  If the DTD does not contain an definition for the element, or the
 *      definition does not have an explicit value then the value in the
 *      AttributeSet will be HTML.NULL_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE.
 *  If the DTD contains an explicit value, as in:
 *      <!ATTLIST OPTION selected (selected) #IMPLIED>
 *      this value from the dtd (in this case selected) will be used.
 *  
 *  
 *  Once the stream has been parsed, the callback is notified of the most
 *  likely end of line string. The end of line string will be one of
 *  \n, \r or \r\n, which ever is encountered the most in parsing the
 *  stream.
