/** Component decorator that implements the view interface
 *  for <object> elements.
 *  
 *  This view will try to load the class specified by the
 *  classid attribute.  If possible, the Classloader
 *  used to load the associated Document is used.
 *  This would typically be the same as the ClassLoader
 *  used to load the EditorKit.  If the document's
 *  ClassLoader is null, Class.forName is used.
 *  
 *  If the class can successfully be loaded, an attempt will
 *  be made to create an instance of it by calling
 *  Class.newInstance.  An attempt will be made
 *  to narrow the instance to type java.awt.Component
 *  to display the object.
 *  
 *  This view can also manage a set of parameters with limitations.
 *  The parameters to the <object> element are expected to
 *  be present on the associated elements attribute set as simple
 *  strings.  Each bean property will be queried as a key on
 *  the AttributeSet, with the expectation that a non-null value
 *  (of type String) will be present if there was a parameter
 *  specification for the property.  Reflection is used to
 *  set the parameter.  Currently, this is limited to a very
 *  simple single parameter of type String.
 *  
 *  A simple example HTML invocation is:
 *  
 *       <object classid="javax.swing.JLabel">
 *       <param name="text" value="sample text">
 *       </object>
 *
