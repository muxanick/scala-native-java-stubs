package javax.swing.text

import java.lang.{Object, String}

/** A plain document that maintains no character attributes.  The
 *  default element structure for this document is a map of the lines in
 *  the text.  The Element returned by getDefaultRootElement is
 *  a map of the lines, and each child element represents a line.
 *  This model does not maintain any character level attributes,
 *  but each line can be tagged with an arbitrary set of attributes.
 *  Line to offset, and offset to line translations can be quickly
 *  performed using the default root element.  The structure information
 *  of the DocumentEvent's fired by edits will indicate the line
 *  structure changes.
 *  
 *  The default content storage management is performed by a
 *  gapped buffer implementation (GapContent).  It supports
 *  editing reasonably large documents with good efficiency when
 *  the edits are contiguous or clustered, as is typical.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
