// An implementation of the AbstractDocument.Content interface that is
// a brute force implementation that is useful for relatively small
// documents and/or debugging.  It manages the character content
// as a simple character array.  It is also quite inefficient.
// 
// It is generally recommended that the gap buffer or piece table
// implementations be used instead.  This buffer does not scale up
// to large sizes.
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
