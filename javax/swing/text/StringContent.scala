/** An implementation of the AbstractDocument.Content interface that is
 *  a brute force implementation that is useful for relatively small
 *  documents and/or debugging.  It manages the character content
 *  as a simple character array.  It is also quite inefficient.
 *  
 *  It is generally recommended that the gap buffer or piece table
 *  implementations be used instead.  This buffer does not scale up
 *  to large sizes.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
