/** An implementation of the document interface to serve as a
 *  basis for implementing various kinds of documents.  At this
 *  level there is very little policy, so there is a corresponding
 *  increase in difficulty of use.
 *  
 *  This class implements a locking mechanism for the document.  It
 *  allows multiple readers or one writer, and writers must wait until
 *  all observers of the document have been notified of a previous
 *  change before beginning another mutation to the document.  The
 *  read lock is acquired and released using the render
 *  method.  A write lock is acquired by the methods that mutate the
 *  document, and are held for the duration of the method call.
 *  Notification is done on the thread that produced the mutation,
 *  and the thread has full read access to the document for the
 *  duration of the notification, but other readers are kept out
 *  until the notification has finished.  The notification is a
 *  beans event notification which does not allow any further
 *  mutations until all listeners have been notified.
 *  
 *  Any models subclassed from this class and used in conjunction
 *  with a text component that has a look and feel implementation
 *  that is derived from BasicTextUI may be safely updated
 *  asynchronously, because all access to the View hierarchy
 *  is serialized by BasicTextUI if the document is of type
 *  AbstractDocument.  The locking assumes that an
 *  independent thread will access the View hierarchy only from
 *  the DocumentListener methods, and that there will be only
 *  one event thread active at a time.
 *  
 *  If concurrency support is desired, there are the following
 *  additional implications.  The code path for any DocumentListener
 *  implementation and any UndoListener implementation must be threadsafe,
 *  and not access the component lock if trying to be safe from deadlocks.
 *  The repaint and revalidate methods
 *  on JComponent are safe.
 *  
 *  AbstractDocument models an implied break at the end of the document.
 *  Among other things this allows you to position the caret after the last
 *  character. As a result of this, getLength returns one less
 *  than the length of the Content. If you create your own Content, be
 *  sure and initialize it to have an additional character. Refer to
 *  StringContent and GapContent for examples of this. Another implication
 *  of this is that Elements that model the implied end character will have
 *  an endOffset == (getLength() + 1). For example, in DefaultStyledDocument
 *  getParagraphElement(getLength()).getEndOffset() == getLength() + 1
 *  .
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
