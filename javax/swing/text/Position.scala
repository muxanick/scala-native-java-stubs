/** Represents a location within a document.  It is intended to abstract away
 *  implementation details of the document and enable specification of
 *  positions within the document that are capable of tracking of change as
 *  the document is edited.
 *  
 *  A Position object points at a location between two characters.
 *  As the surrounding content is altered, the Position object
 *  adjusts its offset automatically to reflect the changes. If content is
 *  inserted or removed before the Position object's location, then the
 *  Position increments or decrements its offset, respectively,
 *  so as to point to the same location. If a portion of the document is removed
 *  that contains a Position's offset, then the Position's
 *  offset becomes that of the beginning of the removed region. For example, if
 *  a Position has an offset of 5 and the region 2-10 is removed, then
 *  the Position's offset becomes 2.
 *  
 *  Position with an offset of 0 is a special case. It never changes its
 *  offset while document content is altered.
