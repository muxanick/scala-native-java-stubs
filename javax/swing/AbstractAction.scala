/** This class provides default implementations for the JFC Action
 *  interface. Standard behaviors like the get and set methods for
 *  Action object properties (icon, text, and enabled) are defined
 *  here. The developer need only subclass this abstract class and
 *  define the actionPerformed method.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
