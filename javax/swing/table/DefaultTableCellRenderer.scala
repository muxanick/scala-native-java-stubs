// The standard class for rendering (displaying) individual cells
// in a JTable.
// 
//
// Implementation Note:
// This class inherits from JLabel, a standard component class.
// However JTable employs a unique mechanism for rendering
// its cells and therefore requires some slightly modified behavior
// from its cell renderer.
// The table class defines a single cell renderer and uses it as a
// as a rubber-stamp for rendering all cells in the table;
// it renders the first cell,
// changes the contents of that cell renderer,
// shifts the origin to the new location, re-draws it, and so on.
// The standard JLabel component was not
// designed to be used this way and we want to avoid
// triggering a revalidate each time the
// cell is drawn. This would greatly decrease performance because the
// revalidate message would be
// passed up the hierarchy of the container to determine whether any other
// components would be affected.
// As the renderer is only parented for the lifetime of a painting operation
// we similarly want to avoid the overhead associated with walking the
// hierarchy for painting operations.
// So this class
// overrides the validate, invalidate,
// revalidate, repaint, and
// firePropertyChange methods to be
// no-ops and override the isOpaque method solely to improve
// performance.  If you write your own renderer,
// please keep this performance consideration in mind.
// 
//
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
