// An AWTEvent that adds support for

// same event types as WindowEvent,
// although different IDs are used.
// Help on handling internal frame events
// is in
// How to Write an Internal Frame Listener,
// a section in The Java Tutorial.
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
