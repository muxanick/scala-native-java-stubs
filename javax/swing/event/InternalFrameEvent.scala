/** An AWTEvent that adds support for
 *  JInternalFrame objects as the event source.  This class has the
 *  same event types as WindowEvent,
 *  although different IDs are used.
 *  Help on handling internal frame events
 *  is in
 *  How to Write an Internal Frame Listener,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
