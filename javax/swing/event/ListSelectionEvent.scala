/** An event that characterizes a change in selection. The change is limited to a
 *  a single inclusive interval. The selection of at least one index within the
 *  range will have changed. A decent ListSelectionModel implementation
 *  will keep the range as small as possible. ListSelectionListeners will
 *  generally query the source of the event for the new selected status of each
 *  potentially changed row.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
