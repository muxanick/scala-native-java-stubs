/** TableModelEvent is used to notify listeners that a table model
 *  has changed. The model event describes changes to a TableModel
 *  and all references to rows and columns are in the co-ordinate
 *  system of the model.
 *  Depending on the parameters used in the constructors, the TableModelevent
 *  can be used to specify the following types of changes:
 * 
 *  
 *  TableModelEvent(source);              //  The data, ie. all rows changed
 *  TableModelEvent(source, HEADER_ROW);  //  Structure change, reallocate TableColumns
 *  TableModelEvent(source, 1);           //  Row 1 changed
 *  TableModelEvent(source, 3, 6);        //  Rows 3 to 6 inclusive changed
 *  TableModelEvent(source, 2, 2, 6);     //  Cell at (2, 6) changed
 *  TableModelEvent(source, 3, 6, ALL_COLUMNS, INSERT); // Rows (3, 6) were inserted
 *  TableModelEvent(source, 3, 6, ALL_COLUMNS, DELETE); // Rows (3, 6) were deleted
 *  
 * 
 *  It is possible to use other combinations of the parameters, not all of them
 *  are meaningful. By subclassing, you can add other information, for example:
 *  whether the event WILL happen or DID happen. This makes the specification
 *  of rows in DELETE events more useful but has not been included in
 *  the swing package as the JTable only needs post-event notification.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
