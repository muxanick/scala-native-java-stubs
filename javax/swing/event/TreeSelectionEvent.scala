// An event that characterizes a change in the current
// selection.  The change is based on any number of paths.
// TreeSelectionListeners will generally query the source of
// the event for the new selected status of each potentially
// changed row.
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
