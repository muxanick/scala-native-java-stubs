/** An event that characterizes a change in the current
 *  selection.  The change is based on any number of paths.
 *  TreeSelectionListeners will generally query the source of
 *  the event for the new selected status of each potentially
 *  changed row.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
