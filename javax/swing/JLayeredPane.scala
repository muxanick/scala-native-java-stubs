/** JLayeredPane adds depth to a JFC/Swing container,
 *  allowing components to overlap each other when needed.
 *  An Integer object specifies each component's depth in the
 *  container, where higher-numbered components sit "on top" of other
 *  components.
 *  For task-oriented documentation and examples of using layered panes see
 *  How to Use a Layered Pane,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
 * 
 *  
 *  
 *    
 *      
 *    
 *  
 *  
 *  For convenience, JLayeredPane divides the depth-range
 *  into several different layers. Putting a component into one of those
 *  layers makes it easy to ensure that components overlap properly,
 *  without having to worry about specifying numbers for specific depths:
 *  
 *     DEFAULT_LAYER
 *          The standard layer, where most components go. This the bottommost
 *          layer.
 *     PALETTE_LAYER
 *          The palette layer sits over the default layer. Useful for floating
 *          toolbars and palettes, so they can be positioned above other components.
 *     MODAL_LAYER
 *          The layer used for modal dialogs. They will appear on top of any
 *          toolbars, palettes, or standard components in the container.
 *     POPUP_LAYER
 *          The popup layer displays above dialogs. That way, the popup windows
 *          associated with combo boxes, tooltips, and other help text will appear
 *          above the component, palette, or dialog that generated them.
 *     DRAG_LAYER
 *          When dragging a component, reassigning it to the drag layer ensures
 *          that it is positioned over every other component in the container. When
 *          finished dragging, it can be reassigned to its normal layer.
 *  
 *  The JLayeredPane methods moveToFront(Component),
 *  moveToBack(Component) and setPosition can be used
 *  to reposition a component within its layer. The setLayer method
 *  can also be used to change the component's current layer.
 * 
 *  Details
 *  JLayeredPane manages its list of children like
 *  Container, but allows for the definition of a several
 *  layers within itself. Children in the same layer are managed exactly
 *  like the normal Container object,
 *  with the added feature that when children components overlap, children
 *  in higher layers display above the children in lower layers.
 *  
 *  Each layer is a distinct integer number. The layer attribute can be set
 *  on a Component by passing an Integer
 *  object during the add call. For example:
 *  
 *      layeredPane.add(child, JLayeredPane.DEFAULT_LAYER);
 *  or
 *      layeredPane.add(child, new Integer(10));
 *  
 *  The layer attribute can also be set on a Component by calling
 *      layeredPaneParent.setLayer(child, 10)
 *  on the JLayeredPane that is the parent of component. The layer
 *  should be set before adding the child to the parent.
 *  
 *  Higher number layers display above lower number layers. So, using
 *  numbers for the layers and letters for individual components, a
 *  representative list order would look like this:
 *        5a, 5b, 5c, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a 
 *  where the leftmost components are closest to the top of the display.
 *  
 *  A component can be moved to the top or bottom position within its
 *  layer by calling moveToFront or moveToBack.
 *  
 *  The position of a component within a layer can also be specified directly.
 *  Valid positions range from 0 up to one less than the number of
 *  components in that layer. A value of -1 indicates the bottommost
 *  position. A value of 0 indicates the topmost position. Unlike layer
 *  numbers, higher position values are lower in the display.
 *  
 *  Note: This sequence (defined by java.awt.Container) is the reverse
 *  of the layer numbering sequence. Usually though, you will use moveToFront,
 *  moveToBack, and setLayer.
 *  
 *  Here are some examples using the method add(Component, layer, position):
 *  Calling add(5x, 5, -1) results in:
 *        5a, 5b, 5c, 5x, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a 
 * 
 *  Calling add(5z, 5, 2) results in:
 *        5a, 5b, 5z, 5c, 5x, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a 
 * 
 *  Calling add(3a, 3, 7) results in:
 *        5a, 5b, 5z, 5c, 5x, 3a, 2a, 2b, 2c, 1a 
 * 
 *  Using normal paint/event mechanics results in 1a appearing at the bottom
 *  and 5a being above all other components.
 *  
 *  Note: that these layers are simply a logical construct and LayoutManagers
 *  will affect all child components of this container without regard for
 *  layer settings.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
