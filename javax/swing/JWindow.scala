/** A JWindow is a container that can be displayed anywhere on the
 *  user's desktop. It does not have the title bar, window-management buttons,
 *  or other trimmings associated with a JFrame, but it is still a
 *  "first-class citizen" of the user's desktop, and can exist anywhere
 *  on it.
 *  
 *  The JWindow component contains a JRootPane
 *  as its only child.  The contentPane should be the parent
 *  of any children of the JWindow.
 *  As a convenience, the add, remove, and setLayout
 *  methods of this class are overridden, so that they delegate calls
 *  to the corresponding methods of the ContentPane.
 *  For example, you can add a child component to a window as follows:
 *  
 *        window.add(child);
 *  
 *  And the child will be added to the contentPane.
 *  The contentPane will always be non-null.
 *  Attempting to set it to null will cause the JWindow
 *  to throw an exception. The default contentPane will have a
 *  BorderLayout manager set on it.
 *  Refer to RootPaneContainer
 *  for details on adding, removing and setting the LayoutManager
 *  of a JWindow.
 *  
 *  Please see the JRootPane documentation for a complete description of
 *  the contentPane, glassPane, and
 *  layeredPane components.
 *  
 *  In a multi-screen environment, you can create a JWindow
 *  on a different screen device.  See Window for more
 *  information.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
