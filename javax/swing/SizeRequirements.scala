/** For the convenience of layout managers,
 *  calculates information about the size and position of components.
 *  All size and position calculation methods are class methods
 *  that take arrays of SizeRequirements as arguments.
 *  The SizeRequirements class supports two types of layout:
 * 
 *  
 *  
 *   tiled
 *   The components are placed end-to-end,
 *       starting either at coordinate 0 (the leftmost or topmost position)
 *       or at the coordinate representing the end of the allocated span
 *       (the rightmost or bottommost position).
 * 
 *   aligned
 *   The components are aligned as specified
 *       by each component's X or Y alignment value.
 *  
 *  
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  Each SizeRequirements object contains information
 *  about either the width (and X alignment)
 *  or height (and Y alignment)
 *  of a single component or a group of components:
 * 
 *  
 *  
 *   minimum
 *   The smallest reasonable width/height of the component
 *       or component group, in pixels.
 * 
 *   preferred
 *   The natural width/height of the component
 *       or component group, in pixels.
 * 
 *   maximum
 *   The largest reasonable width/height of the component
 *       or component group, in pixels.
 * 
 *   alignment
 *   The X/Y alignment of the component
 *       or component group.
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
