/** UIManager manages the current look and feel, the set of
 *  available look and feels, PropertyChangeListeners that
 *  are notified when the look and feel changes, look and feel defaults, and
 *  convenience methods for obtaining various default values.
 * 
 *  Specifying the look and feel
 * 
 *  The look and feel can be specified in two distinct ways: by
 *  specifying the fully qualified name of the class for the look and
 *  feel, or by creating an instance of LookAndFeel and passing
 *  it to setLookAndFeel. The following example illustrates
 *  setting the look and feel to the system look and feel:
 *  
 *    UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
 *  
 *  The following example illustrates setting the look and feel based on
 *  class name:
 *  
 *    UIManager.setLookAndFeel("javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel");
 *  
 *  Once the look and feel has been changed it is imperative to invoke
 *  updateUI on all JComponents. The method SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI(java.awt.Component) makes it easy to apply updateUI to a containment hierarchy. Refer to it for
 *  details. The exact behavior of not invoking updateUI after changing the look and feel is
 *  unspecified. It is very possible to receive unexpected exceptions,
 *  painting problems, or worse.
 * 
 *  Default look and feel
 * 
 *  The class used for the default look and feel is chosen in the following
 *  manner:
 *  
 *    If the system property swing.defaultlaf is
 *        non-null, use its value as the default look and feel class
 *        name.
 *    If the Properties file swing.properties
 *        exists and contains the key swing.defaultlaf,
 *        use its value as the default look and feel class name. The location
 *        that is checked for swing.properties may vary depending
 *        upon the implementation of the Java platform. Typically the
 *        swing.properties file is located in the lib
 *        subdirectory of the Java installation directory.
 *        Refer to the release notes of the implementation being used for
 *        further details.
 *    Otherwise use the cross platform look and feel.
 *  
 * 
 *  Defaults
 * 
 *  UIManager manages three sets of UIDefaults. In order, they
 *  are:
 *  
 *    Developer defaults. With few exceptions Swing does not
 *        alter the developer defaults; these are intended to be modified
 *        and used by the developer.
 *    Look and feel defaults. The look and feel defaults are
 *        supplied by the look and feel at the time it is installed as the
 *        current look and feel (setLookAndFeel() is invoked). The
 *        look and feel defaults can be obtained using the getLookAndFeelDefaults() method.
 *    System defaults. The system defaults are provided by Swing.
 *  
 *  Invoking any of the various get methods
 *  results in checking each of the defaults, in order, returning
 *  the first non-null value. For example, invoking
 *  UIManager.getString("Table.foreground") results in first
 *  checking developer defaults. If the developer defaults contain
 *  a value for "Table.foreground" it is returned, otherwise
 *  the look and feel defaults are checked, followed by the system defaults.
 *  
 *  It's important to note that getDefaults returns a custom
 *  instance of UIDefaults with this resolution logic built into it.
 *  For example, UIManager.getDefaults().getString("Table.foreground")
 *  is equivalent to UIManager.getString("Table.foreground"). Both
 *  resolve using the algorithm just described. In many places the
 *  documentation uses the word defaults to refer to the custom instance
 *  of UIDefaults with the resolution logic as previously described.
 *  
 *  When the look and feel is changed, UIManager alters only the
 *  look and feel defaults; the developer and system defaults are not
 *  altered by the UIManager in any way.
 *  
 *  The set of defaults a particular look and feel supports is defined
 *  and documented by that look and feel. In addition, each look and
 *  feel, or ComponentUI provided by a look and feel, may
 *  access the defaults at different times in their life cycle. Some
 *  look and feels may aggressively look up defaults, so that changing a
 *  default may not have an effect after installing the look and feel.
 *  Other look and feels may lazily access defaults so that a change to
 *  the defaults may effect an existing look and feel. Finally, other look
 *  and feels might not configure themselves from the defaults table in
 *  any way. None-the-less it is usually the case that a look and feel
 *  expects certain defaults, so that in general
 *  a ComponentUI provided by one look and feel will not
 *  work with another look and feel.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
