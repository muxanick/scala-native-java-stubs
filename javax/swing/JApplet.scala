/** An extended version of java.applet.Applet that adds support for
 *  the JFC/Swing component architecture.
 *  You can find task-oriented documentation about using JApplet
 *  in The Java Tutorial,
 *  in the section
 *  How to Make Applets.
 *  
 *  The JApplet class is slightly incompatible with
 *  java.applet.Applet.  JApplet contains a
 *  JRootPane as its only child.  The contentPane
 *  should be the parent of any children of the JApplet.
 *  As a convenience, the add, remove, and setLayout
 *  methods of this class are overridden, so that they delegate calls
 *  to the corresponding methods of the ContentPane.
 *  For example, you can add a child component to an applet as follows:
 *  
 *        applet.add(child);
 *  
 * 
 *  And the child will be added to the contentPane.
 *  The contentPane will always be non-null.
 *  Attempting to set it to null will cause the
 *  JApplet to throw an exception. The default
 *  contentPane will have a BorderLayout
 *  manager set on it.
 *  Refer to RootPaneContainer
 *  for details on adding, removing and setting the LayoutManager
 *  of a JApplet.
 *  
 *  Please see the JRootPane documentation for a
 *  complete description of the contentPane, glassPane,
 *  and layeredPane properties.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
