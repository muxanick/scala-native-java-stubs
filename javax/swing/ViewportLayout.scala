// The default layout manager for JViewport.
// ViewportLayout defines
// a policy for layout that should be useful for most applications.
// The viewport makes its view the same size as the viewport,
// however it will not make the view smaller than its minimum size.
// As the viewport grows the view is kept bottom justified until
// the entire view is visible, subsequently the view is kept top
// justified.
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with

// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
