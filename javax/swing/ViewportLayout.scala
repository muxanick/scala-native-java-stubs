/** The default layout manager for JViewport.
 *  ViewportLayout defines
 *  a policy for layout that should be useful for most applications.
 *  The viewport makes its view the same size as the viewport,
 *  however it will not make the view smaller than its minimum size.
 *  As the viewport grows the view is kept bottom justified until
 *  the entire view is visible, subsequently the view is kept top
 *  justified.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
