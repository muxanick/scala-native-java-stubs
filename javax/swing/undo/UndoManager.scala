/** UndoManager manages a list of UndoableEdits,
 *  providing a way to undo or redo the appropriate edits.  There are
 *  two ways to add edits to an UndoManager.  Add the edit
 *  directly using the addEdit method, or add the
 *  UndoManager to a bean that supports
 *  UndoableEditListener.  The following examples creates
 *  an UndoManager and adds it as an
 *  UndoableEditListener to a JTextField:
 *  
 *    UndoManager undoManager = new UndoManager();
 *    JTextField tf = ...;
 *    tf.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(undoManager);
 *  
 *  
 *  UndoManager maintains an ordered list of edits and the
 *  index of the next edit in that list. The index of the next edit is
 *  either the size of the current list of edits, or if
 *  undo has been invoked it corresponds to the index
 *  of the last significant edit that was undone. When
 *  undo is invoked all edits from the index of the next
 *  edit to the last significant edit are undone, in reverse order.
 *  For example, consider an UndoManager consisting of the
 *  following edits: A b c D.  Edits with a
 *  upper-case letter in bold are significant, those in lower-case
 *  and italicized are insignificant.
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *      
 *  Figure 1
 *  
 *  
 *  As shown in figure 1, if D was just added, the
 *  index of the next edit will be 4. Invoking undo
 *  results in invoking undo on D and setting the
 *  index of the next edit to 3 (edit c), as shown in the following
 *  figure.
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *      
 *  Figure 2
 *  
 *  
 *  The last significant edit is A, so that invoking
 *  undo again invokes undo on c,
 *  b, and A, in that order, setting the index of the
 *  next edit to 0, as shown in the following figure.
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *      
 *  Figure 3
 *  
 *  
 *  Invoking redo results in invoking redo on
 *  all edits between the index of the next edit and the next
 *  significant edit (or the end of the list).  Continuing with the previous
 *  example if redo were invoked, redo would in
 *  turn be invoked on A, b and c.  In addition
 *  the index of the next edit is set to 3 (as shown in figure 2).
 *  
 *  Adding an edit to an UndoManager results in
 *  removing all edits from the index of the next edit to the end of
 *  the list.  Continuing with the previous example, if a new edit,
 *  e, is added the edit D is removed from the list
 *  (after having die invoked on it).  If c is not
 *  incorporated by the next edit
 *  (c.addEdit(e) returns true), or replaced
 *  by it (e.replaceEdit(c) returns true),
 *  the new edit is added after c, as shown in the following
 *  figure.
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *      
 *  Figure 4
 *  
 *  
 *  Once end has been invoked on an UndoManager
 *  the superclass behavior is used for all UndoableEdit
 *  methods.  Refer to CompoundEdit for more details on its
 *  behavior.
 *  
 *  Unlike the rest of Swing, this class is thread safe.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
