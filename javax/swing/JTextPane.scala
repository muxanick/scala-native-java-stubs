/** A text component that can be marked up with attributes that are
 *  represented graphically.
 *  You can find how-to information and examples of using text panes in
 *  Using Text Components,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
 * 
 *  
 *  This component models paragraphs
 *  that are composed of runs of character level attributes.  Each
 *  paragraph may have a logical style attached to it which contains
 *  the default attributes to use if not overridden by attributes set
 *  on the paragraph or character run.  Components and images may
 *  be embedded in the flow of text.
 * 
 *  
 *  Newlines
 *  
 *  For a discussion on how newlines are handled, see
 *  DefaultEditorKit.
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
