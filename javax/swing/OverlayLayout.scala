// A layout manager to arrange components over the top
// of each other.  The requested size of the container
// will be the largest requested size of the children,
// taking alignment needs into consideration.
//
// The alignment is based upon what is needed to properly
// fit the children in the allocation area.  The children
// will be placed such that their alignment points are all
// on top of each other.
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
