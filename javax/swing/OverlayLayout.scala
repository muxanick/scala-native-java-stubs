/** A layout manager to arrange components over the top
 *  of each other.  The requested size of the container
 *  will be the largest requested size of the children,
 *  taking alignment needs into consideration.
 * 
 *  The alignment is based upon what is needed to properly
 *  fit the children in the allocation area.  The children
 *  will be placed such that their alignment points are all
 *  on top of each other.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
