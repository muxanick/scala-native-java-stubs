/** The main class for creating a dialog window. You can use this class
 *  to create a custom dialog, or invoke the many class methods
 *  in JOptionPane to create a variety of standard dialogs.
 *  For information about creating dialogs, see
 *  The Java Tutorial section
 *  How
 *  to Make Dialogs.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 *  The JDialog component contains a JRootPane
 *  as its only child.
 *  The contentPane should be the parent of any children of the
 *  JDialog.
 *  As a convenience, the add, remove, and setLayout
 *  methods of this class are overridden, so that they delegate calls
 *  to the corresponding methods of the ContentPane.
 *  For example, you can add a child component to a dialog as follows:
 *  
 *        dialog.add(child);
 *  
 *  And the child will be added to the contentPane.
 *  The contentPane is always non-null.
 *  Attempting to set it to null generates an exception.
 *  The default contentPane has a BorderLayout
 *  manager set on it.
 *  Refer to RootPaneContainer
 *  for details on adding, removing and setting the LayoutManager
 *  of a JDialog.
 *  
 *  Please see the JRootPane documentation for a complete
 *  description of the contentPane, glassPane,
 *  and layeredPane components.
 *  
 *  In a multi-screen environment, you can create a JDialog
 *  on a different screen device than its owner.  See Frame for
 *  more information.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
