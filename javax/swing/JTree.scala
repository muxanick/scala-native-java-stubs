/** 
 *  A control that displays a set of hierarchical data as an outline.
 *  You can find task-oriented documentation and examples of using trees in
 *  How to Use Trees,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  A specific node in a tree can be identified either by a
 *  TreePath (an object
 *  that encapsulates a node and all of its ancestors), or by its
 *  display row, where each row in the display area displays one node.
 *  An expanded node is a non-leaf node (as identified by
 *  TreeModel.isLeaf(node) returning false) that will displays
 *  its children when all its ancestors are expanded.
 *  A collapsed
 *  node is one which hides them. A hidden node is one which is
 *  under a collapsed ancestor. All of a viewable nodes parents
 *  are expanded, but may or may not be displayed. A displayed node
 *  is both viewable and in the display area, where it can be seen.
 *  
 *  The following JTree methods use "visible" to mean "displayed":
 *  
 *  isRootVisible()
 *  setRootVisible()
 *  scrollPathToVisible()
 *  scrollRowToVisible()
 *  getVisibleRowCount()
 *  setVisibleRowCount()
 *  
 *  The next group of JTree methods use "visible" to mean
 *  "viewable" (under an expanded parent):
 *  
 *  isVisible()
 *  makeVisible()
 *  
 *  If you are interested in knowing when the selection changes implement
 *  the TreeSelectionListener interface and add the instance
 *  using the method addTreeSelectionListener.
 *  valueChanged will be invoked when the
 *  selection changes, that is if the user clicks twice on the same
 *  node valueChanged will only be invoked once.
 *  
 *  If you are interested in detecting either double-click events or when
 *  a user clicks on a node, regardless of whether or not it was selected,
 *  we recommend you do the following:
 *  
 *  
 *  final JTree tree = ...;
 * 
 *  MouseListener ml = new MouseAdapter() {
 *      public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
 *          int selRow = tree.getRowForLocation(e.getX(), e.getY());
 *          TreePath selPath = tree.getPathForLocation(e.getX(), e.getY());
 *          if(selRow != -1) {
 *              if(e.getClickCount() == 1) {
 *                  mySingleClick(selRow, selPath);
 *              }
 *              else if(e.getClickCount() == 2) {
 *                  myDoubleClick(selRow, selPath);
 *              }
 *          }
 *      }
 *  };
 *  tree.addMouseListener(ml);
 *  
 *  NOTE: This example obtains both the path and row, but you only need to
 *  get the one you're interested in.
 *  
 *  To use JTree to display compound nodes
 *  (for example, nodes containing both
 *  a graphic icon and text), subclass TreeCellRenderer and use
 *  setCellRenderer(javax.swing.tree.TreeCellRenderer) to tell the tree to use it. To edit such nodes,
 *  subclass TreeCellEditor and use setCellEditor(javax.swing.tree.TreeCellEditor).
 *  
 *  
 *  Like all JComponent classes, you can use InputMap and
 *  ActionMap
 *  to associate an Action object with a KeyStroke
 *  and execute the action under specified conditions.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
