// Fires one or more ActionEvents at specified
// intervals. An example use is an animation object that uses a
// Timer as the trigger for drawing its frames.
//
// Setting up a timer
// involves creating a Timer object,
// registering one or more action listeners on it,
// and starting the timer using
// the start method.
// For example,
// the following code creates and starts a timer
// that fires an action event once per second
// (as specified by the first argument to the Timer constructor).
// The second argument to the Timer constructor
// specifies a listener to receive the timer's action events.
//
//
//  int delay = 1000; //milliseconds
//  ActionListener taskPerformer = new ActionListener() {
//      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
//          //...Perform a task...
//      }
//  };
//  new Timer(delay, taskPerformer).start();
//
// 
// Timers are constructed by specifying both a delay parameter
// and an ActionListener. The delay parameter is used
// to set both the initial delay and the delay between event
// firing, in milliseconds. Once the timer has been started,
// it waits for the initial delay before firing its
// first ActionEvent to registered listeners.
// After this first event, it continues to fire events
// every time the between-event delay has elapsed, until it
// is stopped.
// 
// After construction, the initial delay and the between-event
// delay can be changed independently, and additional
// ActionListeners may be added.
// 
// If you want the timer to fire only the first time and then stop,
// invoke setRepeats(false) on the timer.
// 
// Although all Timers perform their waiting
// using a single, shared thread
// (created by the first Timer object that executes),
// the action event handlers for Timers
// execute on another thread -- the event-dispatching thread.
// This means that the action handlers for Timers
// can safely perform operations on Swing components.
// However, it also means that the handlers must execute quickly
// to keep the GUI responsive.
//
// 
// In v 1.3, another Timer class was added
// to the Java platform: java.util.Timer.
// Both it and javax.swing.Timer
// provide the same basic functionality,
// but java.util.Timer
// is more general and has more features.
// The javax.swing.Timer has two features
// that can make it a little easier to use with GUIs.
// First, its event handling metaphor is familiar to GUI programmers
// and can make dealing with the event-dispatching thread
// a bit simpler.
// Second, its
// automatic thread sharing means that you don't have to
// take special steps to avoid spawning
// too many threads.
// Instead, your timer uses the same thread
// used to make cursors blink,
// tool tips appear,
// and so on.
//
// 
// You can find further documentation
// and several examples of using timers by visiting
// How to Use Timers,
// a section in The Java Tutorial.
// For more examples and help in choosing between
// this Timer class and
// java.util.Timer,
// see
// Using Timers in Swing Applications,
// an article in The Swing Connection.
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
