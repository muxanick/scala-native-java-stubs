/** Fires one or more ActionEvents at specified
 *  intervals. An example use is an animation object that uses a
 *  Timer as the trigger for drawing its frames.
 * 
 *  Setting up a timer
 *  involves creating a Timer object,
 *  registering one or more action listeners on it,
 *  and starting the timer using
 *  the start method.
 *  For example,
 *  the following code creates and starts a timer
 *  that fires an action event once per second
 *  (as specified by the first argument to the Timer constructor).
 *  The second argument to the Timer constructor
 *  specifies a listener to receive the timer's action events.
 * 
 * 
 *   int delay = 1000; //milliseconds
 *   ActionListener taskPerformer = new ActionListener() {
 *       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
 *           //...Perform a task...
 *       }
 *   };
 *   new Timer(delay, taskPerformer).start();
 * 
 *  
 *  Timers are constructed by specifying both a delay parameter
 *  and an ActionListener. The delay parameter is used
 *  to set both the initial delay and the delay between event
 *  firing, in milliseconds. Once the timer has been started,
 *  it waits for the initial delay before firing its
 *  first ActionEvent to registered listeners.
 *  After this first event, it continues to fire events
 *  every time the between-event delay has elapsed, until it
 *  is stopped.
 *  
 *  After construction, the initial delay and the between-event
 *  delay can be changed independently, and additional
 *  ActionListeners may be added.
 *  
 *  If you want the timer to fire only the first time and then stop,
 *  invoke setRepeats(false) on the timer.
 *  
 *  Although all Timers perform their waiting
 *  using a single, shared thread
 *  (created by the first Timer object that executes),
 *  the action event handlers for Timers
 *  execute on another thread -- the event-dispatching thread.
 *  This means that the action handlers for Timers
 *  can safely perform operations on Swing components.
 *  However, it also means that the handlers must execute quickly
 *  to keep the GUI responsive.
 * 
 *  
 *  In v 1.3, another Timer class was added
 *  to the Java platform: java.util.Timer.
 *  Both it and javax.swing.Timer
 *  provide the same basic functionality,
 *  but java.util.Timer
 *  is more general and has more features.
 *  The javax.swing.Timer has two features
 *  that can make it a little easier to use with GUIs.
 *  First, its event handling metaphor is familiar to GUI programmers
 *  and can make dealing with the event-dispatching thread
 *  a bit simpler.
 *  Second, its
 *  automatic thread sharing means that you don't have to
 *  take special steps to avoid spawning
 *  too many threads.
 *  Instead, your timer uses the same thread
 *  used to make cursors blink,
 *  tool tips appear,
 *  and so on.
 * 
 *  
 *  You can find further documentation
 *  and several examples of using timers by visiting
 *  How to Use Timers,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  For more examples and help in choosing between
 *  this Timer class and
 *  java.util.Timer,
 *  see
 *  Using Timers in Swing Applications,
 *  an article in The Swing Connection.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
