/** Provides the metal look and feel implementation of RootPaneUI.
 *  
 *  MetalRootPaneUI provides support for the
 *  windowDecorationStyle property of JRootPane.
 *  MetalRootPaneUI does this by way of installing a custom
 *  LayoutManager, a private Component to render
 *  the appropriate widgets, and a private Border. The
 *  LayoutManager is always installed, regardless of the value of
 *  the windowDecorationStyle property, but the
 *  Border and Component are only installed/added if
 *  the windowDecorationStyle is other than
 *  JRootPane.NONE.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
