/** Handles the events during a dragging session for a
 *  HORIZONTAL_SPLIT oriented split pane. This continually
 *  messages dragDividerTo and then when done messages
 *  finishDraggingTo. When an instance is created it should be
 *  messaged with isValid to insure that dragging can happen
 *  (dragging won't be allowed if the two views can not be resized).
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
