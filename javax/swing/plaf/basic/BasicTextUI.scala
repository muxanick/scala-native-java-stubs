/** 
 *  Basis of a text components look-and-feel.  This provides the
 *  basic editor view and controller services that may be useful
 *  when creating a look-and-feel for an extension of
 *  JTextComponent.
 *  
 *  Most state is held in the associated JTextComponent
 *  as bound properties, and the UI installs default values for the
 *  various properties.  This default will install something for
 *  all of the properties.  Typically, a LAF implementation will
 *  do more however.  At a minimum, a LAF would generally install
 *  key bindings.
 *  
 *  This class also provides some concurrency support if the
 *  Document associated with the JTextComponent is a subclass of
 *  AbstractDocument.  Access to the View (or View hierarchy) is
 *  serialized between any thread mutating the model and the Swing
 *  event thread (which is expected to render, do model/view coordinate
 *  translation, etc).  Any access to the root view should first
 *  acquire a read-lock on the AbstractDocument and release that lock
 *  in a finally block.
 *  
 *  An important method to define is the getPropertyPrefix() method
 *  which is used as the basis of the keys used to fetch defaults
 *  from the UIManager.  The string should reflect the type of
 *  TextUI (eg. TextField, TextArea, etc) without the particular
 *  LAF part of the name (eg Metal, Motif, etc).
 *  
 *  To build a view of the model, one of the following strategies
 *  can be employed.
 *  
 *  
 *  One strategy is to simply redefine the
 *  ViewFactory interface in the UI.  By default, this UI itself acts
 *  as the factory for View implementations.  This is useful
 *  for simple factories.  To do this reimplement the
 *  create(javax.swing.text.Element) method.
 *  
 *  A common strategy for creating more complex types of documents
 *  is to have the EditorKit implementation return a factory.  Since
 *  the EditorKit ties all of the pieces necessary to maintain a type
 *  of document, the factory is typically an important part of that
 *  and should be produced by the EditorKit implementation.
 *  
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
