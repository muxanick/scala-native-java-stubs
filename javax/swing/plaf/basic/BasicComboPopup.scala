/** This is a basic implementation of the ComboPopup interface.
 * 
 *  This class represents the ui for the popup portion of the combo box.
 *  
 *  All event handling is handled by listener classes created with the
 *  createxxxListener() methods and internal classes.
 *  You can change the behavior of this class by overriding the
 *  createxxxListener() methods and supplying your own
 *  event listeners or subclassing from the ones supplied in this class.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
