/** By default JScrollPane creates scrollbars

 *  of this class.  Scrollbar overrides the
 *  getUnitIncrement and getBlockIncrement
 *  methods so that, if the viewport's view is a Scrollable,
 *  the view is asked to compute these values. Unless
 *  the unit/block increment have been explicitly set.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
