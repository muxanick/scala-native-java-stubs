/** This class is used to create a multiple-exclusion scope for
 *  a set of buttons. Creating a set of buttons with the
 *  same ButtonGroup object means that
 *  turning "on" one of those buttons
 *  turns off all other buttons in the group.
 *  
 *  A ButtonGroup can be used with
 *  any set of objects that inherit from AbstractButton.
 *  Typically a button group contains instances of
 *  JRadioButton,
 *  JRadioButtonMenuItem,
 *  or JToggleButton.
 *  It wouldn't make sense to put an instance of
 *  JButton or JMenuItem
 *  in a button group
 *  because JButton and JMenuItem
 *  don't implement the selected state.
 *  
 *  Initially, all buttons in the group are unselected.
 *  
 *  For examples and further information on using button groups see
 *  How to Use Radio Buttons,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
