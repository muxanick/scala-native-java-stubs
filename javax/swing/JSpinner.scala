/** A single line input field that lets the user select a
 *  number or an object value from an ordered sequence. Spinners typically
 *  provide a pair of tiny arrow buttons for stepping through the elements
 *  of the sequence. The keyboard up/down arrow keys also cycle through the
 *  elements. The user may also be allowed to type a (legal) value directly
 *  into the spinner. Although combo boxes provide similar functionality,
 *  spinners are sometimes preferred because they don't require a drop down list
 *  that can obscure important data.
 *  
 *  A JSpinner's sequence value is defined by its
 *  SpinnerModel.
 *  The model can be specified as a constructor argument and
 *  changed with the model property.  SpinnerModel
 *  classes for some common types are provided: SpinnerListModel,
 *  SpinnerNumberModel, and SpinnerDateModel.
 *  
 *  A JSpinner has a single child component that's
 *  responsible for displaying
 *  and potentially changing the current element or value of
 *  the model, which is called the editor.  The editor is created
 *  by the JSpinner's constructor and can be changed with the
 *  editor property.  The JSpinner's editor stays
 *  in sync with the model by listening for ChangeEvents. If the
 *  user has changed the value displayed by the editor it is
 *  possible for the model's value to differ from that of
 *  the editor. To make sure the model has the same
 *  value as the editor use the commitEdit method, eg:
 *  
 *    try {
 *        spinner.commitEdit();
 *    }
 *    catch (ParseException pe) {
 *        // Edited value is invalid, spinner.getValue() will return
 *        // the last valid value, you could revert the spinner to show that:
 *        JComponent editor = spinner.getEditor();
 *        if (editor instanceof DefaultEditor) {
 *            ((DefaultEditor)editor).getTextField().setValue(spinner.getValue());
 *        }
 *        // reset the value to some known value:
 *        spinner.setValue(fallbackValue);
 *        // or treat the last valid value as the current, in which
 *        // case you don't need to do anything.
 *    }
 *    return spinner.getValue();
 *  
 *  
 *  For information and examples of using spinner see
 *  How to Use Spinners,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
