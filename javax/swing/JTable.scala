/** The JTable is used to display and edit regular two-dimensional tables
 *  of cells.
 *  See How to Use Tables
 *  in The Java Tutorial
 *  for task-oriented documentation and examples of using JTable.
 * 
 *  
 *  The JTable has many
 *  facilities that make it possible to customize its rendering and editing
 *  but provides defaults for these features so that simple tables can be
 *  set up easily.  For example, to set up a table with 10 rows and 10
 *  columns of numbers:
 * 
 *  
 *       TableModel dataModel = new AbstractTableModel() {
 *           public int getColumnCount() { return 10; }
 *           public int getRowCount() { return 10;}
 *           public Object getValueAt(int row, int col) { return new Integer(row*col); }
 *       };
 *       JTable table = new JTable(dataModel);
 *       JScrollPane scrollpane = new JScrollPane(table);
 *  
 *  
 *  JTables are typically placed inside of a JScrollPane.  By
 *  default, a JTable will adjust its width such that
 *  a horizontal scrollbar is unnecessary.  To allow for a horizontal scrollbar,
 *  invoke setAutoResizeMode(int) with AUTO_RESIZE_OFF.
 *  Note that if you wish to use a JTable in a standalone
 *  view (outside of a JScrollPane) and want the header
 *  displayed, you can get it using getTableHeader() and
 *  display it separately.
 *  
 *  To enable sorting and filtering of rows, use a
 *  RowSorter.
 *  You can set up a row sorter in either of two ways:
 *  
 *    Directly set the RowSorter. For example:
 *         table.setRowSorter(new TableRowSorter(model)).
 *    Set the autoCreateRowSorter
 *        property to true, so that the JTable
 *        creates a RowSorter for
 *        you. For example: setAutoCreateRowSorter(true).
 *  
 *  
 *  When designing applications that use the JTable it is worth paying
 *  close attention to the data structures that will represent the table's data.
 *  The DefaultTableModel is a model implementation that
 *  uses a Vector of Vectors of Objects to
 *  store the cell values. As well as copying the data from an
 *  application into the DefaultTableModel,
 *  it is also possible to wrap the data in the methods of the
 *  TableModel interface so that the data can be passed to the
 *  JTable directly, as in the example above. This often results
 *  in more efficient applications because the model is free to choose the
 *  internal representation that best suits the data.
 *  A good rule of thumb for deciding whether to use the AbstractTableModel
 *  or the DefaultTableModel is to use the AbstractTableModel
 *  as the base class for creating subclasses and the DefaultTableModel
 *  when subclassing is not required.
 *  
 *  The "TableExample" directory in the demo area of the source distribution
 *  gives a number of complete examples of JTable usage,
 *  covering how the JTable can be used to provide an
 *  editable view of data taken from a database and how to modify
 *  the columns in the display to use specialized renderers and editors.
 *  
 *  The JTable uses integers exclusively to refer to both the rows and the columns
 *  of the model that it displays. The JTable simply takes a tabular range of cells
 *  and uses getValueAt(int, int) to retrieve the
 *  values from the model during painting.  It is important to remember that
 *  the column and row indexes returned by various JTable methods
 *  are in terms of the JTable (the view) and are not
 *  necessarily the same indexes used by the model.
 *  
 *  By default, columns may be rearranged in the JTable so that the
 *  view's columns appear in a different order to the columns in the model.
 *  This does not affect the implementation of the model at all: when the
 *  columns are reordered, the JTable maintains the new order of the columns
 *  internally and converts its column indices before querying the model.
 *  
 *  So, when writing a TableModel, it is not necessary to listen for column
 *  reordering events as the model will be queried in its own coordinate
 *  system regardless of what is happening in the view.
 *  In the examples area there is a demonstration of a sorting algorithm making
 *  use of exactly this technique to interpose yet another coordinate system
 *  where the order of the rows is changed, rather than the order of the columns.
 *  
 *  Similarly when using the sorting and filtering functionality
 *  provided by RowSorter the underlying
 *  TableModel does not need to know how to do sorting,
 *  rather RowSorter will handle it.  Coordinate
 *  conversions will be necessary when using the row based methods of
 *  JTable with the underlying TableModel.
 *  All of JTables row based methods are in terms of the
 *  RowSorter, which is not necessarily the same as that
 *  of the underlying TableModel.  For example, the
 *  selection is always in terms of JTable so that when
 *  using RowSorter you will need to convert using
 *  convertRowIndexToView or
 *  convertRowIndexToModel.  The following shows how to
 *  convert coordinates from JTable to that of the
 *  underlying model:
 *  
 *    int[] selection = table.getSelectedRows();
 *    for (int i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) {
 *      selection[i] = table.convertRowIndexToModel(selection[i]);
 *    }
 *    // selection is now in terms of the underlying TableModel
 *  
 *  
 *  By default if sorting is enabled JTable will persist the
 *  selection and variable row heights in terms of the model on
 *  sorting.  For example if row 0, in terms of the underlying model,
 *  is currently selected, after the sort row 0, in terms of the
 *  underlying model will be selected.  Visually the selection may
 *  change, but in terms of the underlying model it will remain the
 *  same.  The one exception to that is if the model index is no longer
 *  visible or was removed.  For example, if row 0 in terms of model
 *  was filtered out the selection will be empty after the sort.
 *  
 *  J2SE 5 adds methods to JTable to provide convenient access to some
 *  common printing needs. Simple new print() methods allow for quick
 *  and easy addition of printing support to your application. In addition, a new
 *  getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat) method is available for more advanced printing needs.
 *  
 *  As for all JComponent classes, you can use
 *  InputMap and ActionMap to associate an
 *  Action object with a KeyStroke and execute the
 *  action under specified conditions.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
