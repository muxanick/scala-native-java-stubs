/** A component that displays a list of objects and allows the user to select
 *  one or more items. A separate model, ListModel, maintains the
 *  contents of the list.
 *  
 *  It's easy to display an array or Vector of objects, using the JList
 *  constructor that automatically builds a read-only ListModel instance
 *  for you:
 *  
 *  
 *  // Create a JList that displays strings from an array
 * 
 *  String[] data = {"one", "two", "three", "four"};
 *  JList<String> myList = new JList<String>(data);
 * 
 *  // Create a JList that displays the superclasses of JList.class, by
 *  // creating it with a Vector populated with this data
 * 
 *  Vector<Class<?>> superClasses = new Vector<Class<?>>();
 *  Class<JList> rootClass = javax.swing.JList.class;
 *  for(Class<?> cls = rootClass; cls != null; cls = cls.getSuperclass()) {
 *      superClasses.addElement(cls);
 *  }
 *  JList<Class<?>> myList = new JList<Class<?>>(superClasses);
 * 
 *  // The automatically created model is stored in JList's "model"
 *  // property, which you can retrieve
 * 
 *  ListModel<Class<?>> model = myList.getModel();
 *  for(int i = 0; i < model.getSize(); i++) {
 *      System.out.println(model.getElementAt(i));
 *  }
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  A ListModel can be supplied directly to a JList by way of a
 *  constructor or the setModel method. The contents need not be static -
 *  the number of items, and the values of items can change over time. A correct
 *  ListModel implementation notifies the set of
 *  javax.swing.event.ListDataListeners that have been added to it, each
 *  time a change occurs. These changes are characterized by a
 *  javax.swing.event.ListDataEvent, which identifies the range of list
 *  indices that have been modified, added, or removed. JList's
 *  ListUI is responsible for keeping the visual representation up to
 *  date with changes, by listening to the model.
 *  
 *  Simple, dynamic-content, JList applications can use the
 *  DefaultListModel class to maintain list elements. This class
 *  implements the ListModel interface and also provides a
 *  java.util.Vector-like API. Applications that need a more
 *  custom ListModel implementation may instead wish to subclass
 *  AbstractListModel, which provides basic support for managing and
 *  notifying listeners. For example, a read-only implementation of
 *  AbstractListModel:
 *  
 *  
 *  // This list model has about 2^16 elements.  Enjoy scrolling.
 * 
 *  ListModel<String> bigData = new AbstractListModel<String>() {
 *      public int getSize() { return Short.MAX_VALUE; }
 *      public String getElementAt(int index) { return "Index " + index; }
 *  };
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  The selection state of a JList is managed by another separate
 *  model, an instance of ListSelectionModel. JList is
 *  initialized with a selection model on construction, and also contains
 *  methods to query or set this selection model. Additionally, JList
 *  provides convenient methods for easily managing the selection. These methods,
 *  such as setSelectedIndex and getSelectedValue, are cover
 *  methods that take care of the details of interacting with the selection
 *  model. By default, JList's selection model is configured to allow any
 *  combination of items to be selected at a time; selection mode
 *  MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION. The selection mode can be changed
 *  on the selection model directly, or via JList's cover method.
 *  Responsibility for updating the selection model in response to user gestures
 *  lies with the list's ListUI.
 *  
 *  A correct ListSelectionModel implementation notifies the set of
 *  javax.swing.event.ListSelectionListeners that have been added to it
 *  each time a change to the selection occurs. These changes are characterized
 *  by a javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent, which identifies the range
 *  of the selection change.
 *  
 *  The preferred way to listen for changes in list selection is to add
 *  ListSelectionListeners directly to the JList. JList
 *  then takes care of listening to the the selection model and notifying your
 *  listeners of change.
 *  
 *  Responsibility for listening to selection changes in order to keep the list's
 *  visual representation up to date lies with the list's ListUI.
 *  
 *  
 *  Painting of cells in a JList is handled by a delegate called a
 *  cell renderer, installed on the list as the cellRenderer property.
 *  The renderer provides a java.awt.Component that is used
 *  like a "rubber stamp" to paint the cells. Each time a cell needs to be
 *  painted, the list's ListUI asks the cell renderer for the component,
 *  moves it into place, and has it paint the contents of the cell by way of its
 *  paint method. A default cell renderer, which uses a JLabel
 *  component to render, is installed by the lists's ListUI. You can
 *  substitute your own renderer using code like this:
 *  
 *  
 *   // Display an icon and a string for each object in the list.
 * 
 *  class MyCellRenderer extends JLabel implements ListCellRenderer<Object> {
 *      final static ImageIcon longIcon = new ImageIcon("long.gif");
 *      final static ImageIcon shortIcon = new ImageIcon("short.gif");
 * 
 *      // This is the only method defined by ListCellRenderer.
 *      // We just reconfigure the JLabel each time we're called.
 * 
 *      public Component getListCellRendererComponent(
 *        JList<?> list,           // the list
 *        Object value,            // value to display
 *        int index,               // cell index
 *        boolean isSelected,      // is the cell selected
 *        boolean cellHasFocus)    // does the cell have focus
 *      {
 *          String s = value.toString();
 *          setText(s);
 *          setIcon((s.length() > 10) ? longIcon : shortIcon);
 *          if (isSelected) {
 *              setBackground(list.getSelectionBackground());
 *              setForeground(list.getSelectionForeground());
 *          } else {
 *              setBackground(list.getBackground());
 *              setForeground(list.getForeground());
 *          }
 *          setEnabled(list.isEnabled());
 *          setFont(list.getFont());
 *          setOpaque(true);
 *          return this;
 *      }
 *  }
 * 
 *  myList.setCellRenderer(new MyCellRenderer());
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  Another job for the cell renderer is in helping to determine sizing
 *  information for the list. By default, the list's ListUI determines
 *  the size of cells by asking the cell renderer for its preferred
 *  size for each list item. This can be expensive for large lists of items.
 *  To avoid these calculations, you can set a fixedCellWidth and
 *  fixedCellHeight on the list, or have these values calculated
 *  automatically based on a single prototype value:
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  JList<String> bigDataList = new JList<String>(bigData);
 * 
 *  // We don't want the JList implementation to compute the width
 *  // or height of all of the list cells, so we give it a string
 *  // that's as big as we'll need for any cell.  It uses this to
 *  // compute values for the fixedCellWidth and fixedCellHeight
 *  // properties.
 * 
 *  bigDataList.setPrototypeCellValue("Index 1234567890");
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  JList doesn't implement scrolling directly. To create a list that
 *  scrolls, make it the viewport view of a JScrollPane. For example:
 *  
 *  JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(myList);
 * 
 *  // Or in two steps:
 *  JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane();
 *  scrollPane.getViewport().setView(myList);
 *  
 *  
 *  JList doesn't provide any special handling of double or triple
 *  (or N) mouse clicks, but it's easy to add a MouseListener if you
 *  wish to take action on these events. Use the locationToIndex
 *  method to determine what cell was clicked. For example:
 *  
 *  MouseListener mouseListener = new MouseAdapter() {
 *      public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
 *          if (e.getClickCount() == 2) {
 *              int index = list.locationToIndex(e.getPoint());
 *              System.out.println("Double clicked on Item " + index);
 *           }
 *      }
 *  };
 *  list.addMouseListener(mouseListener);
 *
