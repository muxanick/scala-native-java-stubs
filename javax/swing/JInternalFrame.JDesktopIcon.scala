/** This component represents an iconified version of a
 *  JInternalFrame.
 *  This API should NOT BE USED by Swing applications, as it will go
 *  away in future versions of Swing as its functionality is moved into
 *  JInternalFrame.  This class is public only so that
 *  UI objects can display a desktop icon.  If an application
 *  wants to display a desktop icon, it should create a
 *  JInternalFrame instance and iconify it.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
