/** An extended version of java.awt.Frame that adds support for
 *  the JFC/Swing component architecture.
 *  You can find task-oriented documentation about using JFrame
 *  in The Java Tutorial, in the section
 *  How to Make Frames.
 * 
 *  
 *  The JFrame class is slightly incompatible with Frame.
 *  Like all other JFC/Swing top-level containers,
 *  a JFrame contains a JRootPane as its only child.
 *  The content pane provided by the root pane should,
 *  as a rule, contain
 *  all the non-menu components displayed by the JFrame.
 *  This is different from the AWT Frame case.
 *  As a convenience, the add, remove, and setLayout
 *  methods of this class are overridden, so that they delegate calls
 *  to the corresponding methods of the ContentPane.
 *  For example, you can add a child component to a frame as follows:
 *  
 *        frame.add(child);
 *  
 *  And the child will be added to the contentPane.
 *  The content pane will
 *  always be non-null. Attempting to set it to null will cause the JFrame
 *  to throw an exception. The default content pane will have a BorderLayout
 *  manager set on it.
 *  Refer to RootPaneContainer
 *  for details on adding, removing and setting the LayoutManager
 *  of a JFrame.
 *  
 *  Unlike a Frame, a JFrame has some notion of how to
 *  respond when the user attempts to close the window. The default behavior
 *  is to simply hide the JFrame when the user closes the window. To change the
 *  default behavior, you invoke the method
 *  setDefaultCloseOperation(int).
 *  To make the JFrame behave the same as a Frame
 *  instance, use
 *  setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE).
 *  
 *  For more information on content panes
 *  and other features that root panes provide,
 *  see Using Top-Level Containers in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  In a multi-screen environment, you can create a JFrame
 *  on a different screen device.  See Frame for more
 *  information.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
