/** An implementation of a two-state button.
 *  The JRadioButton and JCheckBox classes
 *  are subclasses of this class.
 *  For information on using them see
 *  How to Use Buttons, Check Boxes, and Radio Buttons,
 *  a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  Buttons can be configured, and to some degree controlled, by
 *  Actions.  Using an
 *  Action with a button has many benefits beyond directly
 *  configuring a button.  Refer to 
 *  Swing Components Supporting Action for more
 *  details, and you can find more information in How
 *  to Use Actions, a section in The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
