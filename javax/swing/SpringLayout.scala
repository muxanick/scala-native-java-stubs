/** A SpringLayout lays out the children of its associated container
 *  according to a set of constraints.
 *  See How to Use SpringLayout
 *  in The Java Tutorial for examples of using
 *  SpringLayout.
 * 
 *  
 *  Each constraint,
 *  represented by a Spring object,
 *  controls the vertical or horizontal distance
 *  between two component edges.
 *  The edges can belong to
 *  any child of the container,
 *  or to the container itself.
 *  For example,
 *  the allowable width of a component
 *  can be expressed using a constraint
 *  that controls the distance between the west (left) and east (right)
 *  edges of the component.
 *  The allowable y coordinates for a component
 *  can be expressed by constraining the distance between
 *  the north (top) edge of the component
 *  and the north edge of its container.
 * 
 *  
 *  Every child of a SpringLayout-controlled container,
 *  as well as the container itself,
 *  has exactly one set of constraints
 *  associated with it.
 *  These constraints are represented by
 *  a SpringLayout.Constraints object.
 *  By default,
 *  SpringLayout creates constraints
 *  that make their associated component
 *  have the minimum, preferred, and maximum sizes
 *  returned by the component's
 *  Component.getMinimumSize(),
 *  Component.getPreferredSize(), and
 *  Component.getMaximumSize()
 *  methods. The x and y positions are initially not
 *  constrained, so that until you constrain them the Component
 *  will be positioned at 0,0 relative to the Insets of the
 *  parent Container.
 * 
 *  
 *  You can change
 *  a component's constraints in several ways.
 *  You can
 *  use one of the
 *  putConstraint
 *  methods
 *  to establish a spring
 *  linking the edges of two components within the same container.
 *  Or you can get the appropriate SpringLayout.Constraints
 *  object using
 *  getConstraints
 *  and then modify one or more of its springs.
 *  Or you can get the spring for a particular edge of a component
 *  using getConstraint,
 *  and modify it.
 *  You can also associate
 *  your own SpringLayout.Constraints object
 *  with a component by specifying the constraints object
 *  when you add the component to its container
 *  (using
 *  Container.add(Component, Object)).
 * 
 *  
 *  The Spring object representing each constraint
 *  has a minimum, preferred, maximum, and current value.
 *  The current value of the spring
 *  is somewhere between the minimum and maximum values,
 *  according to the formula given in the
 *  Spring.sum(javax.swing.Spring, javax.swing.Spring) method description.
 *  When the minimum, preferred, and maximum values are the same,
 *  the current value is always equal to them;
 *  this inflexible spring is called a strut.
 *  You can create struts using the factory method
 *  Spring.constant(int).
 *  The Spring class also provides factory methods
 *  for creating other kinds of springs,
 *  including springs that depend on other springs.
 * 
 *  
 *  In a SpringLayout, the position of each edge is dependent on
 *  the position of just one other edge. If a constraint is subsequently added
 *  to create a new binding for an edge, the previous binding is discarded
 *  and the edge remains dependent on a single edge.
 *  Springs should only be attached
 *  between edges of the container and its immediate children; the behavior
 *  of the SpringLayout when presented with constraints linking
 *  the edges of components from different containers (either internal or
 *  external) is undefined.
 * 
 *  
 *  SpringLayout vs. Other Layout Managers
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *  
 *  Note:
 *  Unlike many layout managers,
 *  SpringLayout doesn't automatically set the location of
 *  the components it manages.
 *  If you hand-code a GUI that uses SpringLayout,
 *  remember to initialize component locations by constraining the west/east
 *  and north/south locations.
 *  
 *  Depending on the constraints you use,
 *  you may also need to set the size of the container explicitly.
 *  
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *  Despite the simplicity of SpringLayout,
 *  it can emulate the behavior of most other layout managers.
 *  For some features,
 *  such as the line breaking provided by FlowLayout,
 *  you'll need to
 *  create a special-purpose subclass of the Spring class.
 * 
 *  
 *  SpringLayout also provides a way to solve
 *  many of the difficult layout
 *  problems that cannot be solved by nesting combinations
 *  of Boxes. That said, SpringLayout honors the
 *  LayoutManager2 contract correctly and so can be nested with
 *  other layout managers -- a technique that can be preferable to
 *  creating the constraints implied by the other layout managers.
 *  
 *  The asymptotic complexity of the layout operation of a SpringLayout
 *  is linear in the number of constraints (and/or components).
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
