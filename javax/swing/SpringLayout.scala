// A SpringLayout lays out the children of its associated container
// according to a set of constraints.
// See How to Use SpringLayout
// in The Java Tutorial for examples of using
// SpringLayout.
//
// 
// Each constraint,
// represented by a Spring object,
// controls the vertical or horizontal distance
// between two component edges.
// The edges can belong to
// any child of the container,
// or to the container itself.
// For example,
// the allowable width of a component
// can be expressed using a constraint
// that controls the distance between the west (left) and east (right)
// edges of the component.
// The allowable y coordinates for a component
// can be expressed by constraining the distance between
// the north (top) edge of the component
// and the north edge of its container.
//
// 
// Every child of a SpringLayout-controlled container,
// as well as the container itself,
// has exactly one set of constraints
// associated with it.
// These constraints are represented by
// a SpringLayout.Constraints object.
// By default,
// SpringLayout creates constraints
// that make their associated component
// have the minimum, preferred, and maximum sizes
// returned by the component's
// Component.getMinimumSize(),
// Component.getPreferredSize(), and
// Component.getMaximumSize()
// methods. The x and y positions are initially not
// constrained, so that until you constrain them the Component
// will be positioned at 0,0 relative to the Insets of the
// parent Container.
//
// 
// You can change
// a component's constraints in several ways.
// You can
// use one of the
// putConstraint
// methods
// to establish a spring
// linking the edges of two components within the same container.
// Or you can get the appropriate SpringLayout.Constraints
// object using
// getConstraints
// and then modify one or more of its springs.
// Or you can get the spring for a particular edge of a component
// using getConstraint,
// and modify it.
// You can also associate
// your own SpringLayout.Constraints object
// with a component by specifying the constraints object
// when you add the component to its container
// (using
// Container.add(Component, Object)).
//
// 
// The Spring object representing each constraint
// has a minimum, preferred, maximum, and current value.
// The current value of the spring
// is somewhere between the minimum and maximum values,
// according to the formula given in the
// Spring.sum(javax.swing.Spring, javax.swing.Spring) method description.
// When the minimum, preferred, and maximum values are the same,
// the current value is always equal to them;
// this inflexible spring is called a strut.
// You can create struts using the factory method
// Spring.constant(int).
// The Spring class also provides factory methods
// for creating other kinds of springs,
// including springs that depend on other springs.
//
// 
// In a SpringLayout, the position of each edge is dependent on
// the position of just one other edge. If a constraint is subsequently added
// to create a new binding for an edge, the previous binding is discarded
// and the edge remains dependent on a single edge.
// Springs should only be attached
// between edges of the container and its immediate children; the behavior
// of the SpringLayout when presented with constraints linking
// the edges of components from different containers (either internal or
// external) is undefined.
//
// 
// SpringLayout vs. Other Layout Managers
// 
//
// 
// 
// Note:
// Unlike many layout managers,
// SpringLayout doesn't automatically set the location of
// the components it manages.
// If you hand-code a GUI that uses SpringLayout,
// remember to initialize component locations by constraining the west/east
// and north/south locations.
// 
// Depending on the constraints you use,
// you may also need to set the size of the container explicitly.
// 
// 
//
// 
// Despite the simplicity of SpringLayout,
// it can emulate the behavior of most other layout managers.
// For some features,
// such as the line breaking provided by FlowLayout,
// you'll need to
// create a special-purpose subclass of the Spring class.
//
// 
// SpringLayout also provides a way to solve
// many of the difficult layout
// problems that cannot be solved by nesting combinations
// of Boxes. That said, SpringLayout honors the
// LayoutManager2 contract correctly and so can be nested with
// other layout managers -- a technique that can be preferable to
// creating the constraints implied by the other layout managers.
// 
// The asymptotic complexity of the layout operation of a SpringLayout
// is linear in the number of constraints (and/or components).
// 
// Warning:
// Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
// future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
// appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
// the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
// of all JavaBeansâ„¢
// has been added to the java.beans package.
// Please see XMLEncoder.
