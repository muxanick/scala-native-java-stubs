/** JSplitPane is used to divide two (and only two)
 *  Components. The two Components
 *  are graphically divided based on the look and feel
 *  implementation, and the two Components can then be
 *  interactively resized by the user.
 *  Information on using JSplitPane is in
 *  How to Use Split Panes in
 *  The Java Tutorial.
 *  
 *  The two Components in a split pane can be aligned
 *  left to right using
 *  JSplitPane.HORIZONTAL_SPLIT, or top to bottom using
 *  JSplitPane.VERTICAL_SPLIT.
 *  The preferred way to change the size of the Components
 *  is to invoke
 *  setDividerLocation where location is either
 *  the new x or y position, depending on the orientation of the
 *  JSplitPane.
 *  
 *  To resize the Components to their preferred sizes invoke
 *  resetToPreferredSizes.
 *  
 *  When the user is resizing the Components the minimum
 *  size of the Components is used to determine the
 *  maximum/minimum position the Components
 *  can be set to. If the minimum size of the two
 *  components is greater than the size of the split pane the divider
 *  will not allow you to resize it. To alter the minimum size of a
 *  JComponent, see JComponent.setMinimumSize(java.awt.Dimension).
 *  
 *  When the user resizes the split pane the new space is distributed between
 *  the two components based on the resizeWeight property.
 *  A value of 0,
 *  the default, indicates the right/bottom component gets all the space,
 *  where as a value of 1 indicates the left/top component gets all the space.
 *  
 *  Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more
 *  information see Swing's Threading
 *  Policy.
 *  
 *  Warning:
 *  Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 *  future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 *  appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 *  the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 *  of all JavaBeansâ„¢
 *  has been added to the java.beans package.
 *  Please see XMLEncoder.
