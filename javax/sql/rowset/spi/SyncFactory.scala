/** The Service Provider Interface (SPI) mechanism that generates SyncProvider
 *  instances to be used by disconnected RowSet objects.
 *  The SyncProvider instances in turn provide the
 *  javax.sql.RowSetReader object the RowSet object
 *  needs to populate itself with data and the
 *  javax.sql.RowSetWriter object it needs to
 *  propagate changes to its
 *  data back to the underlying data source.
 *  
 *  Because the methods in the SyncFactory class are all static,
 *  there is only one SyncFactory object
 *  per Java VM at any one time. This ensures that there is a single source from which a
 *  RowSet implementation can obtain its SyncProvider
 *  implementation.
 * 
 *  1.0 Overview
 *  The SyncFactory class provides an internal registry of available
 *  synchronization provider implementations (SyncProvider objects).
 *  This registry may be queried to determine which
 *  synchronization providers are available.
 *  The following line of code gets an enumeration of the providers currently registered.
 *  
 *      java.util.Enumeration e = SyncFactory.getRegisteredProviders();
 *  
 *  All standard RowSet implementations must provide at least two providers:
 *  
 *   an optimistic provider for use with a CachedRowSet implementation
 *      or an implementation derived from it
 *   an XML provider, which is used for reading and writing XML, such as with
 *        WebRowSet objects
 *  
 *  Note that the JDBC RowSet Implementations include the SyncProvider
 *  implementations RIOptimisticProvider and RIXmlProvider,
 *  which satisfy this requirement.
 *  
 *  The SyncFactory class provides accessor methods to assist
 *  applications in determining which synchronization providers are currently
 *  registered with the SyncFactory.
 *  
 *  Other methods let RowSet persistence providers be
 *  registered or de-registered with the factory mechanism. This
 *  allows additional synchronization provider implementations to be made
 *  available to RowSet objects at run time.
 *  
 *  Applications can apply a degree of filtering to determine the level of
 *  synchronization that a SyncProvider implementation offers.
 *  The following criteria determine whether a provider is
 *  made available to a RowSet object:
 *  
 *  If a particular provider is specified by a RowSet object, and
 *  the SyncFactory does not contain a reference to this provider,
 *  a SyncFactoryException is thrown stating that the synchronization
 *  provider could not be found.
 * 
 *  If a RowSet implementation is instantiated with a specified
 *  provider and the specified provider has been properly registered, the
 *  requested provider is supplied. Otherwise a SyncFactoryException
 *  is thrown.
 * 
 *  If a RowSet object does not specify a
 *  SyncProvider implementation and no additional
 *  SyncProvider implementations are available, the reference
 *  implementation providers are supplied.
 *  
 *  2.0 Registering SyncProvider Implementations
 *  
 *  Both vendors and developers can register SyncProvider
 *  implementations using one of the following mechanisms.
 *  
 *  Using the command line
 *  The name of the provider is supplied on the command line, which will add
 *  the provider to the system properties.
 *  For example:
 *  
 *     -Drowset.provider.classname=com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilityProvider
 *  
 *  Using the Standard Properties File
 *  The reference implementation is targeted
 *  to ship with J2SE 1.5, which will include an additional resource file
 *  that may be edited by hand. Here is an example of the properties file
 *  included in the reference implementation:
 *  
 *    #Default JDBC RowSet sync providers listing
 *    #
 * 
 *    # Optimistic synchronization provider
 *    rowset.provider.classname.0=com.sun.rowset.providers.RIOptimisticProvider
 *    rowset.provider.vendor.0=Oracle Corporation
 *    rowset.provider.version.0=1.0
 * 
 *    # XML Provider using standard XML schema
 *    rowset.provider.classname.1=com.sun.rowset.providers.RIXMLProvider
 *    rowset.provider.vendor.1=Oracle Corporation
 *    rowset.provider.version.1=1.0
 *  
 *  The SyncFactory checks this file and registers the
 *  SyncProvider implementations that it contains. A
 *  developer or vendor can add other implementations to this file.
 *  For example, here is a possible addition:
 *  
 *      rowset.provider.classname.2=com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilityProvider
 *      rowset.provider.vendor.2=Fred, Inc.
 *      rowset.provider.version.2=1.0
 *  
 * 
 *  Using a JNDI Context
 *  Available providers can be registered on a JNDI
 *  context, and the SyncFactory will attempt to load
 *  SyncProvider implementations from that JNDI context.
 *  For example, the following code fragment registers a provider implementation
 *  on a JNDI context.  This is something a deployer would normally do. In this
 *  example, MyProvider is being registered on a CosNaming
 *  namespace, which is the namespace used by J2EE resources.
 *  
 *     import javax.naming.*;
 * 
 *     Hashtable svrEnv = new  Hashtable();
 *     srvEnv.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "CosNaming");
 * 
 *     Context ctx = new InitialContext(svrEnv);
 *     com.fred.providers.MyProvider = new MyProvider();
 *     ctx.rebind("providers/MyProvider", syncProvider);
 *  
 *  
 *  Next, an application will register the JNDI context with the
 *  SyncFactory instance.  This allows the SyncFactory
 *  to browse within the JNDI context looking for SyncProvider
 *  implementations.
 *  
 *     Hashtable appEnv = new Hashtable();
 *     appEnv.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "CosNaming");
 *     appEnv.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "iiop://hostname/providers");
 *     Context ctx = new InitialContext(appEnv);
 * 
 *     SyncFactory.registerJNDIContext(ctx);
 *  
 *  If a RowSet object attempts to obtain a MyProvider
 *  object, the SyncFactory will try to locate it. First it searches
 *  for it in the system properties, then it looks in the resource files, and
 *  finally it checks the JNDI context that has been set. The SyncFactory
 *  instance verifies that the requested provider is a valid extension of the
 *  SyncProvider abstract class and then gives it to the
 *  RowSet object. In the following code fragment, a new
 *  CachedRowSet object is created and initialized with
 *  env, which contains the binding to MyProvider.
 *  
 *     Hashtable env = new Hashtable();
 *     env.put(SyncFactory.ROWSET_SYNC_PROVIDER, "com.fred.providers.MyProvider");
 *     CachedRowSet crs = new com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl(env);
 *  
 *  Further details on these mechanisms are available in the
 *  javax.sql.rowset.spi package specification.
