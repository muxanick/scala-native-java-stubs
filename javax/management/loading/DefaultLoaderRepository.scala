/** Keeps the list of Class Loaders registered in the MBean Server.
 *  It provides the necessary methods to load classes using the registered
 *  Class Loaders.
 * 
 *  This deprecated class is maintained for compatibility.  In
 *  previous versions of JMX, there was one
 *  DefaultLoaderRepository shared by all MBean servers.
 *  As of JMX 1.2, that functionality is approximated by using MBeanServerFactory.findMBeanServer(java.lang.String) to find all known MBean
 *  servers, and consulting the ClassLoaderRepository of each
 *  one.  It is strongly recommended that code referencing
 *  DefaultLoaderRepository be rewritten.
