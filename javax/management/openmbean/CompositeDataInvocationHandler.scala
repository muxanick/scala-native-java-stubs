/** An InvocationHandler that forwards getter methods to a
 *    CompositeData.  If you have an interface that contains
 *    only getter methods (such as String getName() or
 *    boolean isActive()) then you can use this class in
 *    conjunction with the Proxy class to produce an implementation
 *    of the interface where each getter returns the value of the
 *    corresponding item in a CompositeData.
 * 
 *    For example, suppose you have an interface like this:
 * 
 *    
 *    
 *    public interface NamedNumber {
 *        public int getNumber();
 *        public String getName();
 *    }
 *    
 *    
 * 
 *    and a CompositeData constructed like this:
 * 
 *    
 *    
 *    CompositeData cd =
 *        new CompositeDataSupport(
 *            someCompositeType,
 *            new String[] {"number", "name"},
 *            new Object[] {5, "five"}
 *        );
 *    
 *    
 * 
 *    then you can construct an object implementing NamedNumber
 *    and backed by the object cd like this:
 * 
 *    
 *    
 *    InvocationHandler handler =
 *        new CompositeDataInvocationHandler(cd);
 *    NamedNumber nn = (NamedNumber)
 *        Proxy.newProxyInstance(NamedNumber.class.getClassLoader(),
 *                               new Class[] {NamedNumber.class},
 *                               handler);
 *    
 *    
 * 
 *    A call to nn.getNumber() will then return 5.
 * 
 *    If the first letter of the property defined by a getter is a
 *    capital, then this handler will look first for an item in the
 *    CompositeData beginning with a capital, then, if that is
 *    not found, for an item beginning with the corresponding lowercase
 *    letter or code point.  For a getter called getNumber(), the
 *    handler will first look for an item called Number, then for
 *    number.  If the getter is called getnumber(), then
 *    the item must be called number.
 * 
 *    If the method given to invoke is the method
 *    boolean equals(Object) inherited from Object, then
 *    it will return true if and only if the argument is a Proxy
 *    whose InvocationHandler is also a CompositeDataInvocationHandler and whose backing CompositeData is equal (not necessarily identical) to this
 *    object's.  If the method given to invoke is the method
 *    int hashCode() inherited from Object, then it will
 *    return a value that is consistent with this definition of equals: if two objects are equal according to equals, then
 *    they will have the same hashCode.
