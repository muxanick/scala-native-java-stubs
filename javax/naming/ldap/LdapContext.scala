/** This interface represents a context in which you can perform
 *  operations with LDAPv3-style controls and perform LDAPv3-style
 *  extended operations.
 * 
 *  For applications that do not require such controls or extended
 *  operations, the more generic javax.naming.directory.DirContext
 *  should be used instead.
 * 
 *  Usage Details About Controls
 * 
 *  This interface provides support for LDAP v3 controls.
 *  At a high level, this support allows a user
 *  program to set request controls for LDAP operations that are executed
 *  in the course of the user program's invocation of
 *  Context/DirContext
 *  methods, and read response controls resulting from LDAP operations.
 *  At the implementation level, there are some details that developers of
 *  both the user program and service providers need to understand in order
 *  to correctly use request and response controls.
 * 
 *  Request Controls
 *  
 *  There are two types of request controls:
 *  
 *  Request controls that affect how a connection is created
 *  Request controls that affect context methods
 *  
 * 
 *  The former is used whenever a connection needs to be established or
 *  re-established with an LDAP server. The latter is used when all other
 *  LDAP operations are sent to the LDAP server.  The reason why a
 *  distinction between these two types of request controls is necessary
 *  is because JNDI is a high-level API that does not deal directly with
 *  connections.  It is the job of service providers to do any necessary
 *  connection management. Consequently, a single
 *  connection may be shared by multiple context instances, and a service provider
 *  is free to use its own algorithms to conserve connection and network
 *  usage. Thus, when a method is invoked on the context instance, the service
 *  provider might need to do some connection management in addition to
 *  performing the corresponding LDAP operations. For connection management,
 *  it uses the connection request controls, while for the normal
 *  LDAP operations, it uses the context request controls.
 * Unless explicitly qualified, the term "request controls" refers to
 *  context request controls.
 * 
 *  Context Request Controls
 *  There are two ways in which a context instance gets its request controls:
 *  
 *  ldapContext.newInstance(reqCtls)
 *  ldapContext.setRequestControls(reqCtls)
 *  
 *  where ldapContext is an instance of LdapContext.
 *  Specifying null or an empty array for reqCtls
 *  means no request controls.
 *  newInstance() creates a new instance of a context using
 *  reqCtls, while setRequestControls()
 *  updates an existing context instance's request controls to reqCtls.
 *  
 *  Unlike environment properties, request controls of a context instance
 *  are not inherited by context instances that are derived from
 *  it.  Derived context instances have null as their context
 *  request controls.  You must set the request controls of a derived context
 *  instance explicitly using setRequestControls().
 *  
 *  A context instance's request controls are retrieved using
 *  the method getRequestControls().
 * 
 *  Connection Request Controls
 *  There are three ways in which connection request controls are set:
 *  
 *  
 *  new InitialLdapContext(env, connCtls)
 *  refException.getReferralContext(env, connCtls)
 *  ldapContext.reconnect(connCtls);
 *  
 *  where refException is an instance of
 *  LdapReferralException, and ldapContext is an
 *  instance of LdapContext.
 *  Specifying null or an empty array for connCtls
 *  means no connection request controls.
 *  
 *  Like environment properties, connection request controls of a context
 *  are inherited by contexts that are derived from it.
 *  Typically, you initialize the connection request controls using the
 *  InitialLdapContext constructor or
 *  LdapReferralContext.getReferralContext(). These connection
 *  request controls are inherited by contexts that share the same
 *  connection--that is, contexts derived from the initial or referral
 *  contexts.
 *  
 *  Use reconnect() to change the connection request controls of
 *  a context.
 *  Invoking ldapContext.reconnect() affects only the
 *  connection used by ldapContext and any new contexts instances that are
 *  derived form ldapContext. Contexts that previously shared the
 *  connection with ldapContext remain unchanged. That is, a context's
 *  connection request controls must be explicitly changed and is not
 *  affected by changes to another context's connection request
 *  controls.
 *  
 *  A context instance's connection request controls are retrieved using
 *  the method getConnectControls().
 * 
 *  Service Provider Requirements
 * 
 *  A service provider supports connection and context request controls
 *  in the following ways.  Context request controls must be associated on
 *  a per context instance basis while connection request controls must be
 *  associated on a per connection instance basis.  The service provider
 *  must look for the connection request controls in the environment
 *  property "java.naming.ldap.control.connect" and pass this environment
 *  property on to context instances that it creates.
 * 
 *  Response Controls
 * 
 *  The method LdapContext.getResponseControls() is used to
 *  retrieve the response controls generated by LDAP operations executed
 *  as the result of invoking a Context/DirContext
 *  operation. The result is all of the responses controls generated
 *  by the underlying LDAP operations, including any implicit reconnection.
 *  To get only the reconnection response controls,
 *  use reconnect() followed by getResponseControls().
 * 
 *  Parameters
 * 
 *  A Control[] array
 *  passed as a parameter to any method is owned by the caller.
 *  The service provider will not modify the array or keep a reference to it,
 *  although it may keep references to the individual Control objects
 *  in the array.
 *  A Control[] array returned by any method is immutable, and may
 *  not subsequently be modified by either the caller or the service provider.
