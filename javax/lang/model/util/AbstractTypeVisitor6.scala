/** A skeletal visitor of types with default behavior appropriate for
 *  the RELEASE_6
 *  source version.
 * 
 *   WARNING: The TypeVisitor interface implemented
 *  by this class may have methods added to it in the future to
 *  accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to
 *  future versions of the Javaâ„¢ programming language.
 *  Therefore, methods whose names begin with "visit" may be
 *  added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
 *  classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
 *  methods with names beginning with "visit".
 * 
 *  When such a new visit method is added, the default
 *  implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method.  A new abstract type visitor
 *  class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
 *  level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
 *  visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
 *  or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
 * 
 *  Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method
 *  in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a default
 *  method directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8
 *  language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since
 *  this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7
 *  implementations.  Future versions of the API that are only required
 *  to run on Java SE 8 and later may take advantage of default methods
 *  in this situation.
