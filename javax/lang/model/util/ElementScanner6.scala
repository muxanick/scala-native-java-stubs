/** A scanning visitor of program elements with default behavior
 *  appropriate for the RELEASE_6
 *  source version.  The visitXYZ methods in this
 *  class scan their component elements by calling scan on
 *  their enclosed elements,
 *  parameters, etc., as
 *  indicated in the individual method specifications.  A subclass can
 *  control the order elements are visited by overriding the
 *  visitXYZ methods.  Note that clients of a scanner
 *  may get the desired behavior be invoking v.scan(e, p) rather
 *  than v.visit(e, p) on the root objects of interest.
 * 
 *  When a subclass overrides a visitXYZ method, the
 *  new method can cause the enclosed elements to be scanned in the
 *  default way by calling super.visitXYZ.  In this
 *  fashion, the concrete visitor can control the ordering of traversal
 *  over the component elements with respect to the additional
 *  processing; for example, consistently calling
 *  super.visitXYZ at the start of the overridden
 *  methods will yield a preorder traversal, etc.  If the component
 *  elements should be traversed in some other order, instead of
 *  calling super.visitXYZ, an overriding visit method
 *  should call scan with the elements in the desired order.
 * 
 *   Methods in this class may be overridden subject to their
 *  general contract.  Note that annotating methods in concrete
 *  subclasses with @Override will help
 *  ensure that methods are overridden as intended.
 * 
 *   WARNING: The ElementVisitor interface
 *  implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the
 *  future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures
 *  added to future versions of the Javaâ„¢ programming language.
 *  Therefore, methods whose names begin with "visit" may be
 *  added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
 *  classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
 *  methods with names beginning with "visit".
 * 
 *  When such a new visit method is added, the default
 *  implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method.  A new element scanner visitor
 *  class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
 *  level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
 *  visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
 *  or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
