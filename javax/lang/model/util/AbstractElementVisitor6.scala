// A skeletal visitor of program elements with default behavior
// appropriate for the RELEASE_6
// source version.
//
//  WARNING: The ElementVisitor interface
// implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the
// future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures
// added to future versions of the Javaâ„¢ programming language.
// Therefore, methods whose names begin with "visit" may be
// added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
// classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
// methods with names beginning with "visit".
//
// When such a new visit method is added, the default
// implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method.  A new abstract element visitor
// class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
// level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
// visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
// or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
//
// Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method
// in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a default
// method directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8
// language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since
// this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7
// implementations.  Future versions of the API that are only required
// to run on Java SE 8 and later may take advantage of default methods
// in this situation.
