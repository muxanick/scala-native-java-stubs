/** A visitor of program elements based on their kind with default behavior appropriate for the RELEASE_8 source version.  For elements XYZ that may have more than one
 *  kind, the visitXYZ methods in this class delegate
 *  to the visitXYZKind method corresponding to the
 *  first argument's kind.  The visitXYZKind methods
 *  call defaultAction, passing their arguments
 *  to defaultAction's corresponding parameters.
 * 
 *   Methods in this class may be overridden subject to their
 *  general contract.  Note that annotating methods in concrete
 *  subclasses with @Override will help
 *  ensure that methods are overridden as intended.
 * 
 *   WARNING: The ElementVisitor interface
 *  implemented by this class may have methods added to it or the
 *  ElementKind enum used in this case may have
 *  constants added to it in the future to accommodate new, currently
 *  unknown, language structures added to future versions of the
 *  Javaâ„¢ programming language.  Therefore, methods whose names
 *  begin with "visit" may be added to this class in the
 *  future; to avoid incompatibilities, classes which extend this class
 *  should not declare any instance methods with names beginning with
 *  "visit".
 * 
 *  When such a new visit method is added, the default
 *  implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method.  A new abstract element kind
 *  visitor class will also be introduced to correspond to the new
 *  language level; this visitor will have different default behavior
 *  for the visit method in question.  When the new visitor is
 *  introduced, all or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
 * 
 *  Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method
 *  in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a default
 *  method directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8
 *  language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since
 *  this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7
 *  implementations.  Future versions of the API that are only required
 *  to run on Java SE 8 and later may take advantage of default methods
 *  in this situation.
