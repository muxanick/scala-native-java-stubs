/** Defines an abstract implementation of a factory for
 *  getting XMLEventWriters and XMLStreamWriters.
 * 
 *  The following table defines the standard properties of this specification.
 *  Each property varies in the level of support required by each implementation.
 *  The level of support required is described in the 'Required' column.

 *          javax.xml.stream.isRepairingNamespacesdefaults prefixes on the output sideBooleanFalseYes
 *       
 *    
 * 
 *  The following paragraphs describe the namespace and prefix repair algorithm:
 * 
 *  The property can be set with the following code line:
 *  setProperty("javax.xml.stream.isRepairingNamespaces",new Boolean(true|false));
 * 
 *  This property specifies that the writer default namespace prefix declarations.
 *  The default value is false. 
 * 
 *  If a writer isRepairingNamespaces it will create a namespace declaration
 *  on the current StartElement for
 *  any attribute that does not
 *  currently have a namespace declaration in scope.  If the StartElement
 *  has a uri but no prefix specified a prefix will be assigned, if the prefix
 *  has not been declared in a parent of the current StartElement it will be declared
 *  on the current StartElement.  If the defaultNamespace is bound and in scope
 *  and the default namespace matches the URI of the attribute or StartElement
 *  QName no prefix will be assigned.
 * 
 *  If an element or attribute name has a prefix, but is not
 *  bound to any namespace URI, then the prefix will be removed
 *  during serialization.
 * 
 *  If element and/or attribute names in the same start or
 *  empty-element tag are bound to different namespace URIs and
 *  are using the same prefix then the element or the first
 *  occurring attribute retains the original prefix and the
 *  following attributes have their prefixes replaced with a
 *  new prefix that is bound to the namespace URIs of those
 *  attributes. 
 * 
 *  If an element or attribute name uses a prefix that is
 *  bound to a different URI than that inherited from the
 *  namespace context of the parent of that element and there
 *  is no namespace declaration in the context of the current
 *  element then such a namespace declaration is added. 
 * 
 *  If an element or attribute name is bound to a prefix and
 *  there is a namespace declaration that binds that prefix
 *  to a different URI then that namespace declaration is
 *  either removed if the correct mapping is inherited from
 *  the parent context of that element, or changed to the
 *  namespace URI of the element or attribute using that prefix.
