/** This feature clarifies the use of the wsdl:binding
 *  in a JAX-WS runtime.
 * 
 *  This feature can be used during the creation of SEI proxy, and
 *  Dispatch instances on the client side and Endpoint
 *  instances on the server side. This feature cannot be used for Service
 *  instance creation on the client side.
 *  
 *  This feature is only useful with web services that have an
 *  associated WSDL. Enabling this feature requires that a JAX-WS
 *  implementation inspect the wsdl:binding for an
 *  endpoint at runtime to make sure that all wsdl:extensions
 *  that have the required attribute set to true
 *  are understood and are being used.
 *  
 *  The following describes the affects of this feature with respect
 *  to be enabled or disabled:
 *  
 *    ENABLED: In this Mode, a JAX-WS runtime MUST assure that all
 *   required wsdl:binding extensions(including policies) are
 *   either understood and used by the runtime, or explicitly disabled by the
 *   web service application. A web service can disable a particular
 *   extension if there is a corresponding WebServiceFeature or annotation.
 *   Similarly, a web service client can disable
 *   particular extension using the corresponding WebServiceFeature while
 *   creating a proxy or Dispatch instance.
 *   The runtime MUST also make sure that binding of
 *   SEI parameters/return values respect the wsdl:binding.
 *   With this feature enabled, if a required (wsdl:required="true")
 *   wsdl:binding extension is in the WSDL and it is not
 *   supported by a JAX-WS runtime and it has not
 *   been explicitly turned off by the web service developer, then
 *   that JAX-WS runtime MUST behave appropriately based on whether it is
 *   on the client or server:
 *   
 *     Client: runtime MUST throw a
 *   WebServiceException no sooner than when one of the methods
 *   above is invoked but no later than the first invocation of an endpoint
 *   operation.
 *     Server: throw a WebServiceException and the endpoint MUST fail to deploy
 *   
 * 
 *    DISABLED: In this Mode, an implementation may choose whether
 *   to inspect the wsdl:binding or not and to what degree
 *   the wsdl:binding will be inspected.  For example,
 *   one implementation may choose to behave as if this feature is enabled,
 *   another implementation may only choose to verify the SEI's
 *   parameter/return type bindings.
