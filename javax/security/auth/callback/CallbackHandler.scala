package javax.security.auth.callback

/**  An application implements a CallbackHandler and passes
 *  it to underlying security services so that they may interact with
 *  the application to retrieve specific authentication data,
 *  such as usernames and passwords, or to display certain information,
 *  such as error and warning messages.
 * 
 *   CallbackHandlers are implemented in an application-dependent fashion.
 *  For example, implementations for an application with a graphical user
 *  interface (GUI) may pop up windows to prompt for requested information
 *  or to display error messages.  An implementation may also choose to obtain
 *  requested information from an alternate source without asking the end user.
 * 
 *   Underlying security services make requests for different types
 *  of information by passing individual Callbacks to the
 *  CallbackHandler.  The CallbackHandler
 *  implementation decides how to retrieve and display information
 *  depending on the Callbacks passed to it.  For example,
 *  if the underlying service needs a username and password to
 *  authenticate a user, it uses a NameCallback and
 *  PasswordCallback.  The CallbackHandler
 *  can then choose to prompt for a username and password serially,
 *  or to prompt for both in a single window.
 * 
 *   A default CallbackHandler class implementation
 *  may be specified by setting the value of the
 *  auth.login.defaultCallbackHandler security property.
 * 
 *   If the security property is set to the fully qualified name of a
 *  CallbackHandler implementation class,
 *  then a LoginContext will load the specified
 *  CallbackHandler and pass it to the underlying LoginModules.
 *  The LoginContext only loads the default handler
 *  if it was not provided one.
 * 
 *   All default handler implementations must provide a public
 *  zero-argument constructor.
