/** The service provider interface (SPI) for ImageReaders.
 *  For more information on service provider classes, see the class comment
 *  for the IIORegistry class.
 * 
 *   Each ImageReaderSpi provides several types of information
 *  about the ImageReader class with which it is associated.
 * 
 *   The name of the vendor who defined the SPI class and a
 *  brief description of the class are available via the
 *  getVendorName, getDescription,
 *  and getVersion methods.
 *  These methods may be internationalized to provide locale-specific
 *  output.  These methods are intended mainly to provide short,
 *  human-readable information that might be used to organize a pop-up
 *  menu or other list.
 * 
 *   Lists of format names, file suffixes, and MIME types associated
 *  with the service may be obtained by means of the
 *  getFormatNames, getFileSuffixes, and
 *  getMIMETypes methods.  These methods may be used to
 *  identify candidate ImageReaders for decoding a
 *  particular file or stream based on manual format selection, file
 *  naming, or MIME associations (for example, when accessing a file
 *  over HTTP or as an email attachment).
 * 
 *   A more reliable way to determine which ImageReaders
 *  are likely to be able to parse a particular data stream is provided
 *  by the canDecodeInput method.  This methods allows the
 *  service provider to inspect the actual stream contents.
 * 
 *   Finally, an instance of the ImageReader class
 *  associated with this service provider may be obtained by calling
 *  the createReaderInstance method.  Any heavyweight
 *  initialization, such as the loading of native libraries or creation
 *  of large tables, should be deferred at least until the first
 *  invocation of this method.
